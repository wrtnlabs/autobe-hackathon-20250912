/**
 * This E2E test validates the entire workflow of a member user deleting their
 * stock holding in the chatbot system. It begins by registering and logging in
 * a chatbot member user to establish authentication and context. Then, an admin
 * user is registered and logged in to create a new chatbot stock item, which
 * will be used for stock holdings. Next, a chatbot member entity is created for
 * the authenticated member user. Using this member's ID, a stock holding is
 * created referencing the previously created stock item with a quantity. The
 * test then switches back to the member user context and performs the deletion
 * of the created stock holding. Validations ensure successful registration and
 * login of both member and admin users, creation of stock item and stock
 * holding, and proper deletion of the stock holding. Additionally, it tests
 * that attempting to delete another memberâ€™s stock holding is rejected as
 * unauthorized, ensuring authorization enforcement. The test asserts all API
 * responses using typia.assert and performs business logic validations with
 * descriptive TestValidator calls. This test covers critical role-based
 * operations, entity creation, cross-role action authorization, and proper
 * resource cleanup for the stock holding deletion feature.
