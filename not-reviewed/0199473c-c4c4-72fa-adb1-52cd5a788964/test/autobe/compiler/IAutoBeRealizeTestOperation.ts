 * Detailed result interface representing the execution outcome of an individual

 * This interface captures comprehensive information about a single test
 * operation execution, including identification details, execution results,

 * validation of a specific API endpoint or business scenario through Test
 * agent-generated E2E test functions executed against the fully implemented
 * backend application.
 *
 * The operation result provides granular visibility into test execution
 * outcomes, enabling detailed analysis of implementation quality, business
 * logic compliance, and performance characteristics at the individual test
 * level. This detailed tracking supports comprehensive validation reporting and
 * precise identification of implementation issues when they occur.
