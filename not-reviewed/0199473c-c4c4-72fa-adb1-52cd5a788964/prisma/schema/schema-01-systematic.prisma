/// Room tuples define mappings between normal chat rooms and their linked
/// admin rooms. This table stores session isolation mappings and controls
/// admin authorization by maintaining unique identifiers, room IDs, display
/// names, and enablement statuses. It ensures proper role determination and
/// supports operational enablement and soft deletion. Key fields include
/// normal_room_id and admin_room_id for chat routing, display name for
/// identification, and unique_id as a business identity key. Auditing fields
/// track creation, update, and deletion times.
