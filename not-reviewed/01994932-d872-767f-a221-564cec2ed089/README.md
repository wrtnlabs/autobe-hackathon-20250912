## 1. User Message

> Project Title: "Echo" - AI-Powered Assistive Communication App Backend (v2)
> 
> 1. Application Overview
> 
> This project is the backend for Echo, a mobile application designed to assist non-verbal individuals with brain lesions. The application's core function is to convert text to speech (TTS) and provide AI-powered sentence recommendations based on conversational context to facilitate communication. The backend will manage user data, conversation history, and the logic for generating AI suggestions.
> 
> 2. Core Features & Logic
> 
> User Management: Manages user authentication. During signup, the system collects background information via a survey and stores it in the user's profile.
> 
> Context-Aware Conversations: When a conversation begins, the backend captures and stores its context (e.g., date, time, day/night status derived from weather APIs). This context is used to improve the relevance of AI suggestions.
> 
> Conversation Logging: The app records conversations in a "ping-pong" format, storing each utterance from both the user and the person they are talking to (interlocutor).
> 
> AI-Powered Suggestions: The backend provides real-time sentence suggestions. These suggestions are generated by an AI model that uses the transcript and context of the user's last two completed conversations.
> 
> Favorites Management: Users can save and manage a list of frequently used sentences for quick access. This is separate from their conversational history.
> 
> 3. Data Models
> 
> User
> 
> id: (Primary Key)
> 
> password: String, hashed
> 
> surveyData: JSON. Stores background information collected from a survey during signup.
> 
> createdAt: Timestamp
> 
> updatedAt: Timestamp
> 
> Conversation
> 
> id: (Primary Key)
> 
> userId: Foreign Key to User
> 
> context: JSON. Stores environmental context when the conversation starts (e.g., { "timestamp": "...", "season": "Autumn", "timeOfDay": "Night" }). The timeOfDay is determined by comparing the current time with sunrise/sunset data from a weather API.
> 
> startTime: Timestamp
> 
> endTime: Timestamp
> 
> Utterance (Represents a single "Statement" in a conversation)
> 
> id: (Primary Key)
> 
> conversationId: Foreign Key to Conversation
> 
> speaker: Enum (USER, INTERLOCUTOR)
> 
> text: Text. The actual sentence data.
> 
> timestamp: Timestamp
> 
> Favorite
> 
> id: (Primary Key)
> 
> userId: Foreign Key to User
> 
> sentence: Text
> 
> createdAt: Timestamp
> 
> Design Note: A separate Favorite table is used instead of a boolean bookmark field on the Utterance. This allows users to manage a curated list of reusable sentences independently from their conversation history, which is a more flexible and robust approach for the "Favorites Tab" feature.
> 
> 4. API Endpoints
> 
> Please generate a RESTful API with the following endpoints:
> 
> Authentication (/api/auth)
> 
> POST /signup: Creates a new user.
> 
> Request Body: { "password": "...", "surveyData": { ... } }
> 
> Response: { "userId": "...", "token": "..." }
> 
> POST /login: Authenticates a user.
> 
> Request Body: { "userId": "...", "password": "..." }
> 
> Response: { "userId": "...", "token": "..." }
> 
> User Settings (/api/users)
> 
> PUT /me/profile: Allows a user to update their profile, including the initial survey data.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Request Body: { "surveyData": { ... } }
> 
> Response: { "userId": "...", "surveyData": { ... } }
> 
> Favorites (/api/favorites)
> 
> GET /: Retrieves all favorite sentences for the authenticated user.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Response: [{ "id": "...", "sentence": "..." }, ...]
> 
> POST /: Adds a new sentence to the user's favorites.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Request Body: { "sentence": "Hello, how are you?" }
> 
> Response: { "id": "...", "sentence": "Hello, how are you?" }
> 
> Conversation (/api/conversations)
> 
> POST /: Initiates a new conversation session.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Logic: Upon creation, the backend should immediately call the external weather API to determine sunrise/sunset times, calculate if it's day or night, and save this along with the date/time into the context field of the new Conversation record.
> 
> Response: { "conversationId": "...", "context": { ... } }
> 
> POST /:conversationId/utterances: Saves a single utterance to a specific conversation.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Request Body: { "speaker": "USER", "text": "I would like a coffee." }
> 
> Response: 201 Created
> 
> GET /history: Retrieves a list of the user's past conversations.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Response: [{ "id": "...", "startTime": "...", "context": {...} }, ...]
> 
> AI Suggestions (/api/ai)
> 
> GET /suggestions: Generates and returns AI-powered sentence suggestions.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Logic: This endpoint should retrieve the context and all Utterance records from the last two conversations. This data is formatted as a single prompt and sent to an LLM.
> 
> Response: { "suggestions": ["Suggestion 1", "Suggestion 2", "Suggestion 3"] }
> 
> External Services (/api/external)
> 
> GET /weather: A proxy endpoint to fetch weather data.
> 
> Authentication: Required.
> 
> Query Params: ?lat=...&lon=...
> 
> Logic: Makes a server-side request to an external weather API.
> 
> Response: { "sunrise": "06:05", "sunset": "19:30", "temperature": "22°C" }

## 2. Assistant Message

> Thank you for the detailed project description for "Echo," the AI-powered assistive communication app backend.
> 
> To confirm, here is a high-level summary of your requirements:
> 
> - Users are people with brain lesions who use the app to communicate non-verbally.
> - The backend manages users, their profiles including a survey, conversation history, and favorites.
> - Conversations are logged with contextual data such as time, date, and day/night status derived from weather APIs.
> - AI suggestions for sentences are generated based on the last two conversations.
> - The backend will provide authentication, profile update, favorites management, conversation logging, AI suggestion generation, and a proxy to a weather API.
> - Data entities include User, Conversation, Utterance, and Favorite.
> - REST APIs cover authentication, user profile, conversation management, favorites, AI suggestions, and external weather data.
> 
> Before proceeding to formalize these specifications and generate the backend code, I would like to clarify a few points to fully understand your needs:
> 
> 1. Authentication:
>    - Should signup require email or username besides password, or is userId sufficient?
>    - Do you want password reset or other auth features?
> 
> 2. User survey data:
>    - Is the survey schema fixed or can it evolve? Should we validate its structure?
> 
> 3. Context for conversation:
>    - You mentioned timeOfDay is based on sunrise/sunset data; do you want the backend to call a specific external weather API provider for this? Any preferred provider or API key?
> 
> 4. AI Suggestions:
>    - Do you have a preferred AI or LLM provider or API for sentence suggestions, or should this be abstracted in the backend?
> 
> 5. Rate limiting, security, and privacy concerns:
>    - Any special requirements? For example, encryption for sensitive data or API usage limits?
> 
> 6. Hosting or database preferences:
>    - Should we target any specific database system? For example, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB?
> 
> Answering these will help me finalize the specifications appropriately. Also, do you want me to take care of detailed API validation, error handling, and authorization enforcement in the design? 
> 
> Please let me know or clarify any other features or constraints you wish to add.
> To summarize your project "Echo" backend:
> 
> - Manage users with signup/login including survey data
> - Track conversations with context (time, day/night from weather API)
> - Log utterances (user/interlocutor statements)
> - Provide AI-generated sentence suggestions based on last two conversations
> - Manage user's favorite sentences separately
> - Support RESTful APIs with authentication and proxy to weather API
> 
> Before I create a detailed specification and start development, I have some questions for clarification:
> 
> 1. Should users have identifiers other than userId, like email or username?
> 2. Is the survey data format fixed? Should it be validated or flexible JSON?
> 3. Which weather API will you use? Should I integrate a specific provider or keep it generic?
> 4. Which AI service or model do you plan to use for suggestions, or should the backend just forward requests?
> 5. Any particular security or privacy requirements? For example, encrypting sensitive data?
> 6. Preferred database system or hosting environment?
> 
> Also, do you want features like password reset or email verification in authentication?
> 
> Please let me know so I can finalize and proceed.

## 5. User Message

> Thank you for the clarifying questions. Here are the details to finalize the specifications:
> 
> On Authentication: Let's keep it simple. A user-chosen, unique userId and a password will be the only credentials required. There's no need to implement email-based login or password reset features at this stage.
> 
> On User Survey Data: The schema for the survey data is fixed and will not change. Therefore, the backend should perform strict validation on the incoming survey data to ensure it matches the defined structure.
> 
> On AI Suggestions: For the LLM, please integrate with OpenAI's GPT API. The backend should be designed to handle the API key securely and format the conversation history as a prompt for the model.
> 
> On the Weather API: We will use the official Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) API, provided through the government's public data portal. The backend must be built to interface with this specific service to fetch sunrise/sunset times and other relevant weather data.

## 6. Assistant Message

> Thanks for the clarifications! To summarize and confirm before proceeding:
> 
> - Authentication will use unique userId plus password only; no email or password reset features.
> - Survey data has a fixed schema and will be strictly validated on the backend.
> - For AI suggestions, we will integrate OpenAI's GPT API securely, formatting conversation history into prompts.
> - For weather data, we will interface with the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) official API to fetch sunrise/sunset and temperature info.
> 
> With these clear specs and your earlier detailed feature list, I now have sufficient information to generate a comprehensive requirements specification document.
> 
> Shall I proceed to run the Analyze agent to formalize your backend requirements into precise specs?
