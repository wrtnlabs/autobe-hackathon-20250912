# Echo Backend External Integrations Requirements

## 1. Introduction

The Echo backend integrates critical external services to support its assistive communication functionalities focused on non-verbal users with brain lesions. This document specifies business requirements for these integrations ensuring secure, reliable, and context-aware operations.

## 2. Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) Weather API Integration

### 2.1 Integration Purpose
The KMA Weather API supplies environmental data such as sunrise, sunset, and temperature needed to contextualize conversations with day/night status and seasonal information, improving AI suggestion relevance.

### 2.2 Input and Output Specifications
- Inputs:
  - Latitude (`lat`) and longitude (`lon`) parameters to query weather conditions accurately.
- Outputs:
  - JSON response including fields: `sunrise`, `sunset`, and `temperature`.

### 2.3 Business Logic
- WHEN a new conversation is initiated, THE backend SHALL call the KMA API with correct geographic coordinates immediately.
- THE backend SHALL retrieve sunrise and sunset times.
- THE backend SHALL determine if current conversation start time is within daytime or nighttime by comparing with sunrise and sunset.
- THE backend SHALL store this `timeOfDay` context alongside `timestamp` and optionally `season` derived from date.
- IF KMA API call fails, THEN THE backend SHALL retry once; if retry fails, THE backend SHALL continue allowing conversation creation with null context values.

### 2.4 Error Handling
- RETRIES limited to one on failure.
- FALLBACK to null context rather than blocking conversation creation.
- FAILURES SHALL be logged for operational monitoring.

## 3. OpenAI GPT API Integration for AI Sentence Suggestions

### 3.1 Integration Purpose
This API produces real-time, contextually relevant sentence suggestions enhancing communication efficiency for non-verbal users.

### 3.2 Input Data Preparation
- On user request, THE system SHALL fetch full conversational transcripts and context from the last two completed conversations.
- THE system SHALL compile these into a single prompt compatible with OpenAI GPT API specifications.

### 3.3 API Invocation
- THE backend SHALL securely call the OpenAI GPT API using stored API keys.
- THE backend SHALL handle key management and restrict exposure.

### 3.4 Response Handling
- THE backend SHALL parse and relay at least three sentence suggestions back to the user.
- Response times SHALL meet usability expectations (within 3 seconds usually).

### 3.5 Failure Management
- IF OpenAI GPT API call fails, THEN THE backend SHALL:
  - Return a meaningful user-facing error indicating unavailability.
  - Log the error details.

## 4. API Security and Key Management

- THE backend SHALL authenticate all external API requests.
- API keys SHALL be stored securely and access-restricted.
- Regular key rotation SHALL be implemented.

## 5. Privacy and Compliance

- Conversations sent to OpenAI SHALL be anonymized as much as feasible.
- User consent for external data usage SHALL be enforced in compliance with regulations.

## 6. Summary

External integrations with KMA Weather API and OpenAI GPT API form vital components for Echo's assistive communication capabilities. This document provides clear actionable business requirements for these integrations.
Developers must implement these with security, reliability, and user experience foremost.
