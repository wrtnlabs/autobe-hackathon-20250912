Application Overview\n\nThis project is the backend for Echo, a mobile application designed to assist non-verbal individuals with brain lesions. The application's core function is to convert text to speech (TTS) and provide AI-powered sentence recommendations based on conversational context to facilitate communication. The backend will manage user data, conversation history, and the logic for generating AI suggestions.\n\n2. Core Features & Logic\n\nUser Management: Manages user authentication. During signup, the system collects background information via a survey and stores it in the user's profile.\n\nContext-Aware Conversations: When a conversation begins, the backend captures and stores its context (e.g., date, time, day/night status derived from weather APIs). This context is used to improve the relevance of AI suggestions.\n\nConversation Logging: The app records conversations in a \"ping-pong\" format, storing each utterance from both the user and the person they are talking to (interlocutor).\n\nAI-Powered Suggestions: The backend provides real-time sentence suggestions. These suggestions are generated by an AI model that uses the transcript and context of the user's last two completed conversations.\n\nFavorites Management: Users can save and manage a list of frequently used sentences for quick access. This is separate from their conversational history.\n\n3. Data Models\n\nUser\n\nid: (Primary Key)\n\npassword: String, hashed\n\nsurveyData: JSON. Stores background information collected from a survey during signup.\n\ncreatedAt: Timestamp\n\nupdatedAt: Timestamp\n\nConversation\n\nid: (Primary Key)\n\nuserId: Foreign Key to User\n\ncontext: JSON. Stores environmental context when the conversation starts (e.g., { \"timestamp\": \"...\", \"season\": \"Autumn\", \"timeOfDay\": \"Night\" }). The timeOfDay is determined by comparing the current time with sunrise/sunset data from a weather API.\n\nstartTime: Timestamp\n\nendTime: Timestamp\n\nUtterance (Represents a single \"Statement\" in a conversation)\n\nid: (Primary Key)\n\nconversationId: Foreign Key to Conversation\n\nspeaker: Enum (USER, INTERLOCUTOR)\n\ntext: Text. The actual sentence data.\n\ntimestamp: Timestamp\n\nFavorite\n\nid: (Primary Key)\n\nuserId: Foreign Key to User\n\nsentence: Text\n\ncreatedAt: Timestamp\n\nDesign Note: A separate Favorite table is used instead of a boolean bookmark field on the Utterance. This allows users to manage a curated list of reusable sentences independently from their conversation history, which is a more flexible and robust approach for the \"Favorites Tab\" feature.\n\n4. API Endpoints\n\nPlease generate a RESTful API with the following endpoints:\n\nAuthentication (/api/auth)\n\nPOST /signup: Creates a new user.\n\nRequest Body: { \"password\": \"...\", \"surveyData\": { ... } }\n\nResponse: { \"userId\": \"...\", \"token\": \"...\" }\n\nPOST /login: Authenticates a user.\n\nRequest Body: { \"userId\": \"...\", \"password\": \"...\" }\n\nResponse: { \"userId\": \"...\", \"token\": \"...\" }\n\nUser Settings (/api/users)\n\nPUT /me/profile: Allows a user to update their profile, including the initial survey data.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nRequest Body: { \"surveyData\": { ... } }\n\nResponse: { \"userId\": \"...\", \"surveyData\": { ... } }\n\nFavorites (/api/favorites)\n\nGET /: Retrieves all favorite sentences for the authenticated user.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nResponse: [{ \"id\": \"...\", \"sentence\": \"...\" }, ...]\n\nPOST /: Adds a new sentence to the user's favorites.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nRequest Body: { \"sentence\": \"Hello, how are you?\" }\n\nResponse: { \"id\": \"...\", \"sentence\": \"Hello, how are you?\" }\n\nConversation (/api/conversations)\n\nPOST /: Initiates a new conversation session.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nLogic: Upon creation, the backend should immediately call the external weather API to determine sunrise/sunset times, calculate if it's day or night, and save this along with the date/time into the context field of the new Conversation record.\n\nResponse: { \"conversationId\": \"...\", \"context\": { ... } }\n\nPOST /:conversationId/utterances: Saves a single utterance to a specific conversation.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nRequest Body: { \"speaker\": \"USER\", \"text\": \"I would like a coffee.\" }\n\nResponse: 201 Created\n\nGET /history: Retrieves a list of the user's past conversations.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nResponse: [{ \"id\": \"...\", \"startTime\": \"...\", \"context\": {...} }, ...]\n\nAI Suggestions (/api/ai)\n\nGET /suggestions: Generates and returns AI-powered sentence suggestions.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nLogic: This endpoint should retrieve the context and all Utterance records from the last two conversations. This data is formatted as a single prompt and sent to an LLM.\n\nResponse: { \"suggestions\": [\"Suggestion 1\", \"Suggestion 2\", \"Suggestion 3\"] }\n\nExternal Services (/api/external)\n\nGET /weather: A proxy endpoint to fetch weather data.\n\nAuthentication: Required.\n\nQuery Params: ?lat=...&lon=...\n\nLogic: Makes a server-side request to an external weather API.\n\nResponse: { \"sunrise\": \"06:05\", \"sunset\": \"19:30\", \"temperature\": \"22°C\" }"}],"created_at":"2025-09-14T17:22:04.614Z"},{"id":"0199493f-8c2a-746d-a804-98577c054c7e","type":"assistantMessage","text":"Thank you for the detailed project description for \"Echo,\" the AI-powered assistive communication app backend.\n\nTo confirm, here is a high-level summary of your requirements:\n\n- Users are people with brain lesions who use the app to communicate non-verbally.\n- The backend manages users, their profiles including a survey, conversation history, and favorites.\n- Conversations are logged with contextual data such as time, date, and day/night status derived from weather APIs.\n- AI suggestions for sentences are generated based on the last two conversations.\n- The backend will provide authentication, profile update, favorites management, conversation logging, AI suggestion generation, and a proxy to a weather API.\n- Data entities include User, Conversation, Utterance, and Favorite.\n- REST APIs cover authentication, user profile, conversation management, favorites, AI suggestions, and external weather data.\n\nBefore proceeding to formalize these specifications and generate the backend code, I would like to clarify a few points to fully understand your needs:\n\n1. Authentication:\n   - Should signup require email or username besides password, or is userId sufficient?\n   - Do you want password reset or other auth features?\n\n2. User survey data:\n   - Is the survey schema fixed or can it evolve? Should we validate its structure?\n\n3. Context for conversation:\n   - You mentioned timeOfDay is based on sunrise/sunset data; do you want the backend to call a specific external weather API provider for this? Any preferred provider or API key?\n\n4. AI Suggestions:\n   - Do you have a preferred AI or LLM provider or API for sentence suggestions, or should this be abstracted in the backend?\n\n5. Rate limiting, security, and privacy concerns:\n   - Any special requirements? For example, encryption for sensitive data or API usage limits?\n\n6. Hosting or database preferences:\n   - Should we target any specific database system? For example, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB?\n\nAnswering these will help me finalize the specifications appropriately. Also, do you want me to take care of detailed API validation, error handling, and authorization enforcement in the design? \n\nPlease let me know or clarify any other features or constraints you wish to add.\nTo summarize your project \"Echo\" backend:\n\n- Manage users with signup/login including survey data\n- Track conversations with context (time, day/night from weather API)\n- Log utterances (user/interlocutor statements)\n- Provide AI-generated sentence suggestions based on last two conversations\n- Manage user's favorite sentences separately\n- Support RESTful APIs with authentication and proxy to weather API\n\nBefore I create a detailed specification and start development, I have some questions for clarification:\n\n1. Should users have identifiers other than userId, like email or username?\n2. Is the survey data format fixed? Should it be validated or flexible JSON?\n3. Which weather API will you use? Should I integrate a specific provider or keep it generic?\n4. Which AI service or model do you plan to use for suggestions, or should the backend just forward requests?\n5. Any particular security or privacy requirements? For example, encrypting sensitive data?\n6. Preferred database system or hosting environment?\n\nAlso, do you want features like password reset or email verification in authentication?\n\nPlease let me know so I can finalize and proceed.","created_at":"2025-09-14T17:22:05.482Z","completed_at":"2025-09-14T17:22:13.552Z"},{"id":"01994932-dc83-7582-9cfa-c85d27b0f41e","type":"userMessage","contents":[{"type":"text","text":"hello, 너가 할수 있는건 뭐야?"}],"created_at":"2025-09-14T17:08:14.083Z"},{"id":"01994932-df31-76b9-aded-8388bb245856","type":"assistantMessage","text":"Hello! 저는 백엔드 서버 개발 자동화를 지원하는 AI입니다. \n\n제가 할 수 있는 일은 주로 사용자가 원하는 백엔드 시스템 요구사항을 자세히 듣고, 이 요구사항을 토대로 다음과 같은 작업들을 단계별로 자동으로 진행하는 것입니다:\n\n1. 요구사항 분석 - 사용자의 비즈니스와 기능 요구를 명확한 사양 문서로 정리해요.\n2. 데이터베이스 설계 - 요구사항에 맞는 데이터 모델과 스키마를 만들어요.\n3.

It provides backend developers with clear, detailed, and unambiguous guidance on how data flows within the system, how events trigger changes, policies for retaining data, and audit logging requirements.\n\nThis document focuses exclusively on business requirements and logical workflows. It does not include technical implementation details such as database schemas or API design.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nThe Echo backend serves to assist non-verbal individuals with brain lesions by converting text to speech and providing AI-powered sentence suggestions. To fulfill its mission, the backend must manage user data securely and efficiently, log conversations, support AI suggestions, and handle favorites.\n\nThis document addresses how data moves and transforms throughout the backend, how relevant system events are processed, and the rules that govern data retention and audit logging.\n\nKey business drivers:\n- Ensure user confidentiality and data integrity.\n- Provide accurate, contextual AI suggestions.\n- Support reliable conversation history and favorites management.\n- Enable system traceability and compliance through audit logs.\n\n\n## 2.

Event Processing Logic\n\n### 3.1 User Registration\n\nWHEN a new user submits signup data, THE system SHALL:\n- Validate that the userId is unique and adheres to allowed formats.\n- Validate the password meets security criteria.\n- Validate the survey data matches the fixed schema.\n- Create a new user profile including the hashed password and survey data.\n- Record the timestamp of profile creation.\n- Provide an authentication token for subsequent access.\n\n\n### 3.2 User Authentication\n\nWHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL:\n- Validate the userId exists.\n- Verify the password against the stored hash.\n- On success, generate a valid authentication token.\n- On failure, return an authentication error.\n\n\n### 3.3 Profile Update\n\nWHEN an authenticated user submits a profile update request, THE system SHALL:\n- Validate the new survey data against the defined schema.\n- Update the user profile with new data.\n- Record the update timestamp.\n\n\n### 3.4 Conversation Initiation\n\nWHEN a user starts a new conversation, THE system SHALL:\n- Capture the current timestamp.\n- Query the KMA Weather API for sunrise and sunset times at the user's location.\n- Calculate if the conversation occurs during day or night.\n- Store the conversation context, including timestamp, season, and timeOfDay.\n- Create a new Conversation record associated with the user.\n\n\n### 3.5 Utterance Logging\n\nWHEN a user or interlocutor sends an utterance, THE system SHALL:\n- Validate the conversation exists and is active.\n- Store the utterance with speaker, text content, and timestamp.\n- Maintain the correct sequence to preserve conversational order.\n\n\n### 3.6 AI Sentence Suggestion\n\nWHEN a user requests AI suggestions, THE system SHALL:\n- Retrieve the last two completed conversations along with their utterances.\n- Format this data as a prompt compliant with the OpenAI GPT API requirements.\n- Send the data securely to the API.\n- Return multiple sentence suggestions to the user.\n\n\n### 3.7 Favorites Management\n\nWHEN a user adds a sentence to favorites, THE system SHALL:\n- Validate the sentence text is non-empty and within length limits.\n- Create a Favorite record linked to the user.\n\nWHEN a user requests favorite sentences, THE system SHALL:\n- Retrieve all favorites associated with the user.\n\nWHEN a user deletes a favorite, THE system SHALL:\n- Remove the favorite record.\n\n\n## 4. Data Retention Policies\n\n### 4.1 User Data Retention\n\nTHE system SHALL retain user profiles, including survey data, for as long as the user account is active.\n\nWHEN a user deletes their account, THE system SHALL:\n- Delete all associated data including profile, conversations, utterances, and favorites within 30 calendar days.\n\n\n### 4.2 Conversation History\n\nTHE system SHALL:\n- Retain conversation records and related utterances for a minimum of 2 years from the last update.\n- Archive older conversation data if necessary to maintain system performance.\n\n\n### 4.3 Favorites Data\n\nTHE system SHALL retain favorite sentences as long as the associated user account exists.\n\nWHEN a user deletes a favorite sentence, THE system SHALL remove it permanently.\n\n\n### 4.4 Audit Logs\n\nAudit logs SHALL be retained for 3 years minimum to comply with security and compliance needs.\n\n\n## 5. Audit Trail Management\n\nTHE system SHALL log the following actions with timestamps, user identifiers, and action details:\n- User account creation, login, logout, and profile updates.\n- Conversation creations and closures.\n- Utterance additions.\n- Favorite sentence additions, updates, and deletions.\n- External API requests and responses (weather and AI suggestion calls).\n\n\nTHE audit logs SHALL be immutable and securely stored to prevent tampering.\n\nLogs MUST support querying by userId and action type for troubleshooting and audits.\n\n\n## 6. Summary\n\nThis document provides all necessary business requirements for the data lifecycle and event processing system of the Echo backend. It ensures clarity, integrity, and compliance for user data management and processing.\n\nBackend developers have full autonomy over architecture, API design, and database implementations. This documentation specifies what the system must do, not how to build it.\n\n---\n\n> *Developer Note: This document provides business requirements only.
