## 2. Assistant Message

> Thank you for sharing the detailed functional specification for the Telegram File Downloader API. Here is a brief summary of the key points I understand so far:
> 
> - The system automatically downloads files (videos, images, archives, documents, etc.) shared in Telegram channels or groups.
> - There are three user roles: End Users (via a web dashboard), Developers/Marketers (via API), and Administrators.
> - Core features include authentication and user management with subscription plans (free/pro), Stripe payment integration, file download with filtering and date range options, file storage locally and in AWS S3, API endpoints to request downloads, check progress, list files, pricing plans for free and pro tiers, and a dashboard UI for managing requests and subscriptions.
> 
> Before proceeding with formal requirements analysis, I want to clarify a few details to ensure the specification covers everything needed:
> 
> 1. Regarding authentication:
>    - Should users be able to reset or recover their password?
>    - Are social logins (e.g., Google, Telegram OAuth) considered or only email/password?
> 
> 2. For file downloads:
>    - Will the service actively monitor Telegram channels for new files, or is it only on-demand downloads triggered by users?
>    - Is there a maximum number of files or maximum file size per download request?
>    - Should users be able to specify multiple channels/groups in one request?
> 
> 3. About storage:
>    - Will there be file retention policies or auto-deletion for files after some time?
>    - Should files be accessible via public URLs after download or require authentication to access?
> 
> 4. For the API:
>    - Apart from the three stated endpoints (/download, /status/{jobId}, /files), are there any others planned (e.g., user management, subscription status)?
>    - Should API access be restricted by subscription plan (e.g., rate limiting)?
> 
> 5. About the web dashboard:
>    - Should administrators have a separate admin panel distinct from user dashboards?
>    - What metrics or logs should administrators be able to view specifically?
> 
> Please let me know if any of these points need adjustment or expansion. Also, feel free to add any other requirements or constraints I haven't covered yet. Once we finalize the details, I will proceed with analyzing the requirements to create a structured specification document.

## 4. Assistant Message

> Thank you for the detailed clarifications. To summarize the refined requirements for the Telegram File Downloader API MVP:
> 
> - Authentication supports email/password with password reset via email; no social logins initially.
> - File downloads are on-demand (no continuous monitoring), limited to one channel per request.
> - Free plan limits: max 10 files/day, max 100MB per file.
> - Pro plan limits: configurable with larger file size (e.g., up to 2GB/file).
> - File retention of 7 days with automatic deletion.
> - Download links use signed URLs for authenticated access.
> - API endpoints will include /download, /status/{jobId}, /files, plus /me (user profile & subscription) and /usage (quota usage).
> - API rate limiting based on subscription plan.
> - Separate admin panel for administrators with metrics on downloads, storage, subscriptions, payments.
> 
> If you confirm that this summary is accurate and complete, I am ready to proceed with analyzing these requirements to create a structured specification document. Would you like me to start this next step? Or do you wish to add or refine anything further?

## 5. User Message

> Yes, this summary is accurate and complete for the MVP scope.
