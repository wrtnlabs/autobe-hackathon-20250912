   * crawling tasks. It requires ownership or management privileges for the

   *
   * The API request must include details such as the crawl job ID and initial
   * crawl attempt metadata like the start time. The response confirms
   * creation with complete crawl attempt details.
   *
   * This operation interacts directly with the
   * political_news_crawler_crawl_attempts database table, ensuring each crawl
   * attempt is logged accurately for audit and operational monitoring.
   *
   * Validation rules prevent creation with nonexistent crawl job IDs and
   * ensure timestamp formats conform to ISO 8601 standards.
   *
   * This API is typically called by backend scheduler services or crawling
   * orchestrators to start crawl attempts.
