   * Delete a specific processing alert by ID.
   *
   * This API endpoint provides the capability to erase a specified processing
   * alert by accepting its unique identifier as a path parameter.
   *
   * The processing alerts represent system notifications for issues
   * encountered during the LLM post-processing pipeline, such as failures,
   * retries, or other significant events requiring operational attention.
   *
   * Proper authorization is required, typically limited to users with the
   * "guest" role to prevent unauthorized data loss.
   *
   * The operation deletes the processing alert permanently from the system,
   * meaning the record cannot be recovered after deletion.
   *
   * Users must ensure the 'id' corresponds to a valid existing alert record
   * to avoid errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param id Unique identifier of the processing alert to delete
