   * Create new popular political topic.
   *
   * Creates a new popular political topic within the system. Users can
   * specify a unique topic code and title to identify trending or important
   * political themes. An optional description provides further context or
   * details about the topic. This operation inserts a new row into
   * political_news_crawler_popular_topics which serves as the primary entity
   * representing popular political topics.
   *
   * Security considerations require that only authorized parties (e.g.,
   * system administrators) perform this operation to prevent duplicates or
   * invalid entries. Validation ensures topic_code uniqueness and title
   * presence.
   *
   * This operation integrates with related tables: popularity_scores and
   * topic_mentions, which track dynamic scoring and article references
   * respectively. Creating a topic is a prerequisite for recording its
   * popularity and news mentions.
   *
   * Expected behavior includes returning the full created topic entity upon
   * successful creation. Errors may arise from duplicate topic codes or
   * validation failures.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Creation info of the popular topic

   * Security measures mandate authorized access to prevent unauthorized
   * modifications. Validation includes ensuring continued uniqueness of
