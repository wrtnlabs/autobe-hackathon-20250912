   * Retrieve a crawl alert detail by ID.

   * Retrieve detailed information about a specific crawl alert by its unique
   * ID. The crawl alert entity logs critical events in the crawling process
   * such as bans, network errors, or throttle warnings related to specific
   * crawl sources. This data helps system operators monitor crawler health
   * and perform diagnostics.

   * Access to this endpoint requires appropriate permissions reflecting user
   * roles responsible for viewing operational alerts.

   * The response returns all available metadata for the alert including its
   * type, descriptive message, severity level, and timestamps. If the alert
   * has been soft deleted, it will still be retrievable for audit purposes.
   *
   * This retrieval operation maps directly to the
   * political_news_crawler_crawl_alerts database table, ensuring consistent
   * data mapping and field representation.
   *
   * Clients should handle not found errors appropriately if the specified
   * alert ID does not exist or has been deleted permanently.
