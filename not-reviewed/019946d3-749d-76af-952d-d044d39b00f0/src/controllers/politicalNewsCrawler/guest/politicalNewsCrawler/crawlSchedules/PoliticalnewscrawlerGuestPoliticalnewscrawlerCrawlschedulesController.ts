   * and how often a crawl source should be crawled. The crawl schedule
   * includes a cron expression specifying the timing, links to the crawl
   * source and crawl policy to control crawl frequency and backoff
   * strategies, and flags to enable or disable the schedule.
   *
   * Security considerations restrict this operation to authorized roles
   * managing crawling infrastructure.

   * The created schedule is registered in the
   * political_news_crawler_crawl_schedules table, with all required
   * validations for data integrity and foreign key constraints against
   * crawl_sources and crawl_policies.
   *
   * Expected behavior includes returning the newly created schedule with all
   * relevant metadata.
   *
   * Errors are raised for invalid references or conflicting schedules. The
   * operation never supports soft-deletion here, and data is persistently
   * stored.
