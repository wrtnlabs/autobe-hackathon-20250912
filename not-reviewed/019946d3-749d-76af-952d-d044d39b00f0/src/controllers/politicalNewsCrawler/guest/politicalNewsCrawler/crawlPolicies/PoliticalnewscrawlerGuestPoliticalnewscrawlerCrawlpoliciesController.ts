  /**
   * Update an existing crawl policy in politicalNewsCrawler.
   *
   * This endpoint updates the details of an existing crawl policy used by the
   * politicalNewsCrawler system to govern crawl scheduling and error
   * handling. Updating crawl policies enables administrators to adjust
   * parameters including:
   *
   * - Maximum crawl frequency in minutes to control how often crawls are
   *   scheduled.
   * - Maximum retry attempts to specify how many times to retry failed crawling
   *   operations before aborting.
   * - Backoff multiplier controlling the exponential delay applied between
   *   retries.
   * - Ban detection enabled flag indicating whether the system should actively
   *   detect and handle bans.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only authorized backend administrators should
   * have access to update crawl policies to prevent disruption of crawling
   * behavior. The operation updates a single policy record identified by the
   * provided UUID path parameter, ensuring precise targeting.
   *
   * The operation interfaces with the underlying
   * political_news_crawler_crawl_policies table, modifying fields according
   * to the request payload. Proper validation is performed to ensure data
   * integrity.
   *
   * In case of errors (e.g., invalid ID or data), the system returns
   * appropriate HTTP error status codes. Successful updates return the
   * modified crawl policy entity reflecting the new parameters.
