## 4. Assistant Message

> Hello! You have described an ambitious and highly innovative SaaS platform—FlowSphere—that aims to revolutionize project management and AI-assisted software development by fully automating project ideation, planning, task breakdown, documentation, AI IDE integration, team collaboration, and cost optimization.
> 
> To proceed effectively, I’d like to ensure we capture your vision and requirements precisely, so here are a few clarifying questions and points before I initiate detailed analysis:
> 
> 1. **User Roles and Access Levels**  
>    Could you confirm the core user types? E.g., individual developers, project managers, team leads, specific developer roles (frontend, backend, QA, etc.), and maybe also guest/observer roles?
> 
> 2. **Project Input**  
>    Will the project idea input be entirely conversational via chat? Or will you consider support for uploading existing documents or templates for AI to analyze?
> 
> 3. **AI IDEs and MCP Server**  
>    You mention integration with multiple AI IDEs through an MCP server protocol to share context and track progress. Would you like this to support any specific IDEs first, or should it be designed generically with plugin architecture?
> 
> 4. **Documentation Automation**  
>    You listed many document types (PRD, SRS, MVP, API Docs, etc.). Should the system allow users to configure which docs to generate per project, or always generate all by default?
> 
> 5. **Task Management and Prompts**  
>    Do you envision users interacting with tasks primarily through your platform’s UI with prompts auto-generated for each task? How granular should task status updates be (e.g., auto-updated from IDE code changes, manual updates, or both)?
> 
> 6. **Team and Collaboration**  
>    In team mode, how do you want assignments and workload balancing handled? Automatically by AI based on expertise, manually by project managers, or both options?
> 
> 7. **Token Usage and Cost Optimization**  
>    Your concern about token cost reduction is important. Do you want the system to dynamically choose AI models per task based on complexity and token budgets? Also, should it handle caching and batch processing internally?
> 
> 8. **Memory and Context Management**  
>    FlowSphere will maintain long-term project memory and context compression. Do you want visualizations or dashboards showing project history, decisions, and code evolution?
> 
> 9. **Additional Features**  
>    Are there any other features or integrations you wish to highlight? (e.g., CI/CD pipeline integration, analytics dashboards, user feedback collection)
> 
> Once you confirm or add details here, I will start organizing all requirements into a clear, structured specification document. This will help us proceed to designing the database schema and APIs smoothly.
> 
> Please let me know your input on the above points or if you want me to begin drafting the detailed specification based on what you’ve shared so far!

## 6. Assistant Message

> Thank you for sharing this extraordinarily detailed and structured overview of the FlowSphere SaaS platform. This documentation provides a very strong foundation covering vision, core problems, solutions, feature sets, technical architecture, demo plan, prompt engineering, success metrics, and more.
> 
> To move forward with backend development automation for FlowSphere, I would like to clarify or confirm a few points so I can proceed with the requirements analysis:
> 
> 1. Would you please confirm if the primary user roles and permissions are as outlined — individuals (freelancers, students), small teams (with roles like frontend/backend/devops/QA), and enterprise teams?
> 
> 2. Should the backend handle project creation, user authentication, roles, project memory context, document storage & versioning, task hierarchies with prompts, and real-time synchronization as per the doc?
> 
> 3. Is integrating with multiple AI models and MCP protocol primarily a backend concern at this stage, or will you want me to focus now on data modeling, core API design, and user/project management?
> 
> 4. For the database schema, the example Supabase tables are very helpful. Would you like me to proceed creating a full schema along these lines including tasks, projects, documents, users, roles, permissions, and context storage?
> 
> 5. Are there any particular data relations, business rules, or constraints you want emphasized that we should discuss before starting analysis?
> 
> Once I have your confirmation or any additional details, I will execute the requirements analysis step to generate a structured specification document for FlowSphere backend development.

> 
> 
> # FlowSphere Demo Version Guide
> 
> 
> ## Purpose
> This guide defines the exact scope, flow, success criteria, and fallback controls for a zero‑error, highly reliable demo of FlowSphere within 6–8 days. It prioritizes determinism (Safe Mode), selective document generation, and a single high‑signal AI feature.
> 
> 
> ## Demo Scope (Must Work 150%)
> - Authentication: signup/login, protected endpoints (prefer hosted provider for speed and reliability).
> - Projects: create/list (per‑user), delete (admin‑only), pagination + search.
> - Tasks: create/list under a project (ownership checks).
> - AI Showcase: Generate “Feature → Plan” with Task → Mini → Micro breakdown, role‑based prompts, and cached outputs.
> - Document Factory: Generate selected docs (PRD, MVP, SRS; optional ADD, TDD, API Spec, DDD, SAD, Deployment Guide, UXD, UI Spec). View as Markdown; provide pre‑rendered PDFs for demo.
> - Context Timeline: Persist generation events and show history.
> - Health & OpenAPI: `/health`, `/openapi.json` respond 200.
> 
> 
> ## Safe Mode (Determinism First)
> - Toggle: Safe Mode ON by default for demo.
> - Behavior: Prefer cached outputs; call free‑tier models only if upstream is healthy and within timeout.
> - Cache key: `hash(projectId + featureInput + params)`.
> - Fallbacks: If AI fails or times out, return last‑good cached or curated sample.
> - Telemetry: Off in demo to reduce variability; redacted logs only.
> 
> 
> ## End‑to‑End Demo Flow (Script)
> 1) Sign up/login.
> 2) Create a Project (name + description).
> 3) Open “Generate Plan,” paste a short feature idea.
> 4) See proposed Features/Definitions → request a small change (conversation loop).
> 5) Approve → Generate selected docs (PRD/MVP/SRS); show PDF download.
> 6) Approve docs → Decompose into Task → Mini → Micro with prompts, dependencies, estimates, acceptance criteria.
> 7) Show Context Timeline entries for generation and approvals.
> 8) As admin, delete a project; show 403 for non‑admin.
> 
> 
> ## UI Outline (Minimal, Reliable)
> - Navbar: Dashboard | Projects | Generate Plan | Documents | Timeline | Account
> - Projects: table with search/pagination; detail page with tasks list.
> - Generate Plan: form (feature idea + complexity), action button, results tabs:
>   - Tasks: tree with Task → Mini → Micro
>   - Prompts: role‑based prompt cards (copy button)
>   - Docs: PRD/MVP/SRS viewers with “Download PDF”
> - Timeline: chronological list of events with links to artifacts.
> 
> 
> ## Data Shapes (Canonical)
> - Task/Mini/Micro: `{ id, title, description, role, estimateHours, dependencies: string[], acceptanceCriteria: string[], status, promptId }`
> - Prompt: `{ id, role, objective, inputContext, steps: string[], definitionOfDone, guardrails }`
> - Document: `{ id, type: 'PRD'|'MVP'|'SRS'|..., version, markdown, pdfUrl?, updatedAt }`
> - Context Entry: `{ id, projectId, type: 'GENERATION'|'REVISION'|'APPROVAL', summary, payloadRef, createdAt }`
> 
> 
> ## Reliability Controls
> - Validation: Zod on all writes; consistent ApiResponse format.
> - Timeouts: AI calls ≤ 8s; retry ×1; then cached fallback.
> - Idempotency: generation keyed by cache hash; repeatable outputs in Safe Mode.
> - Seeds: demo seed script creates a sample user, project, and curated artifacts.
> - Port hygiene: kill port 3001 before start; single server instance.
> 
> 
> ## Preconditions
> - Environment variables set; database reachable; seed completed.
> - Safe Mode ON; curated samples present; PDFs pre‑rendered.
> - CI green (type‑check, lint, build, prisma generate/migrate, smoke script).
> 
> 
> ## Smoke Test (Deterministic)
> Execute a 10‑step script that:
> 1) Health check 200
> 2) Register/login → token
> 3) Create project 201
> 4) List projects filtered by user 200
> 5) Generate Plan (Safe Mode) 200; artifacts persisted
> 6) Docs list contains PRD/MVP/SRS; PDFs downloadable
> 7) Decomposition tree present with prompts
> 8) Timeline has generation entries
> 9) Non‑admin delete → 403
> 10) Admin elevate → delete project 200
> 
> 
> ## Success Criteria
> - No unhandled errors in UI/console/logs; all API calls in demo flow 2xx (except expected 403).
> - All pages load < 2s; API p95 < 200ms in Safe Mode.
> - Docs and task tree render correctly and match cached artifacts.
> - At least one PDF downloads and opens locally.
> 
> 
> ## Risk Matrix & Fallbacks
> - Auth outage → local bypass token behind flag (last resort).
> - AI outage/limits → cached results or curated samples.
> - DB hiccup → pre‑seeded JSON render path for UI viewers.
> - Network flakiness → Safe Mode only; disable live AI.
> 
> 
> ## Day‑by‑Day Example Plan (6–8 Days)
> - Day 1: Data shapes, seeds, Safe Mode, read‑only UI for seeded artifacts.
> - Day 2: Generate Plan (cached), persist artifacts, timeline; PDFs ready.
> - Day 3: Free‑model router wiring with caching + fallback.
> - Day 4: Polishing (deps view, acceptance criteria, prompts copy, ToC).
> - Day 5: QA smoke script, CI checks, perf pass.
> - Day 6–8: Buffer, bug bash, dry‑runs.
> 
> 
> ## Presentation Tips
> - Drive the exact script; avoid unscoped exploration.
> - Call out Safe Mode (determinism) and Cached Fallbacks (reliability).
> - Emphasize AI‑native differentiation: conversational edits → docs → tasks/prompt tree → timeline memory.
