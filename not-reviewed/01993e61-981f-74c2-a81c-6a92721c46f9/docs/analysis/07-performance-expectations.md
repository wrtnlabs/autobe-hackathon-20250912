# FlowSphere Functional Requirements and Business Specifications

## 1. Overview

FlowSphere is an AI-powered 360Â° project management SaaS platform designed to transform user ideas into executable software projects through conversational ideation, detailed documentation generation, granular task decomposition, AI IDE integration, and efficient team collaboration. Its primary goal is to enable rapid, cost-effective, and context-preserving AI-assisted development workflows that overcome challenges like AI IDE memory loss and token cost explosion.

### Business Model

- Addresses the demand for AI-driven software development automation tools.
- Targets AI-first teams, freelancers, hackathons, and enterprises requiring accelerated delivery and reduced documentation and AI usage costs.
- Offers seamless project transformation from idea to execution with persistent project memory and optimized AI integration.

## 2. Project Ideation Workflow

### User Interaction

WHEN a user submits a new project idea (brief or detailed), THE system SHALL engage the user in a conversational brainstorming session to refine project scope, identify key features, and assess feasibility.

THE system SHALL employ AI-driven analysis to automatically extract core project requirements, risks, and technology stack recommendations based on user input.

### Business Rules

- WHEN the ideation session begins, THE system SHALL create a persistent conversational context associated with the project.
- THE system SHALL allow iterative user refinement of ideas with context preservation.

### Performance

- THE system SHALL deliver initial refined feature extraction results within 5 seconds.

## 3. Document Generation Pipeline

### Core Documents

THE system SHALL automatically generate the following project documentation types:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) structure
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Application Design Document (ADD)
- Technical Design Document (TDD)
- API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Database Design Document (DDD)
- Security Architecture Document (SAD)
- Deployment Guides and Runbooks
- User Experience Document (UXD)
- UI Specifications and Design System
- Test Plans and QA Strategy
- Release Plans and Roadmaps
- Performance Requirements
- Monitoring and Observability Plans
- Business Logic Documentation
- Integration Specifications
- Compliance and Legal Requirements

### Generation and Updates

WHEN a project is created or updated, THE system SHALL generate or regenerate selected documentation in real-time or on demand.

THE system SHALL support selective generation allowing users to choose specific documents to create or update.

THE system SHALL maintain version histories for all documents, tracking changes with diff views.

THE system SHALL export documentation in PDF, Markdown, Notion, Confluence, and Jira-compatible formats.

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL synchronize document contents automatically with changes in the project plan and task statuses.
- Visual diagrams such as ERDs, flowcharts, and architecture diagrams SHALL be auto-generated and embedded in relevant documents.

### Performance

- THE system SHALL generate or update a full set of documents within 30 seconds.

## 4. Task Decomposition Engine

### Decomposition Levels

THE system SHALL decompose projects into multi-level task hierarchies:
- Epic (major feature or module)
- Task (feature implementation)
- Mini-task (component work)
- Micro-task (single-function or method implementations)
- Atomic task (minimal atomic code changes)

### Task Attributes

- THE system SHALL assign role-specific tasks aligned with project roles including Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer, UI/UX Designer, and AI Specialist.

- Tasks SHALL include estimated effort, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and AI-generated optimized prompts for AI IDE consumption.

- THE system SHALL provide all necessary context with each task to support AI IDE development.

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL update task statuses automatically based on AI IDE feedback and manual updates.
- THE system SHALL enable dependency mapping with clear prerequisite visualization.

### Performance

- Task breakdown and prompt generation SHALL complete within 15 seconds for enterprise-scale projects.

## 5. AI IDE Integration

### MCP Server Protocol

THE system SHALL implement the MCP server protocol to enable real-time context sharing and synchronization with supported AI IDEs including Cursor AI, Codeium, GitHub Copilot, and others.

### Features

- Real-time project state synchronization to the AI IDE.
- Automatic task progress updates based on IDE activity.
- Smart task suggestion and prioritization.
- Automated code quality gates and review triggers.
- Live synchronization of documentation changes with code.
- Real-time team notifications.

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL support pluggable IDE integrations to accommodate emerging AI tools.

### Performance

- Sync latency SHALL not exceed 2 seconds for real-time collaboration.

## 6. Context Management

### Persistent Project Memory

THE system SHALL maintain a comprehensive project memory capturing:
- Complete conversational history and ideation timeline.
- Decision rationale and change logs.
- Code and architecture evolution.
- Performance baseline and bug-fix patterns.

### Context Compression

THE system SHALL perform smart summarization and relevance scoring to compress historical context while preserving critical information.

THE system SHALL budget token usage dynamically to optimize AI call costs.

### Performance

- Context loading SHALL be progressive, loading only necessary context per task.

## 7. Team Collaboration

### Role-Based Coordination

THE system SHALL assign tasks based on expertise, role, and workload balancing.

THE system SHALL provide dashboards for monitoring timelines, budgets, and risks.

### Features

- Daily standup automation generating progress reports.
- Visual dependency graphs highlighting blockers.
- Automatic routing of code reviews.
- Knowledge sharing and capture.

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL prevent task overallocation.
- THE system SHALL allow manual role reassignment by authorized managers.

## 8. Cost Optimization

### Token Efficiency

THE system SHALL reduce AI token consumption by 60-80% via:
- Context caching and reuse.
- Dynamic AI model selection.
- Batch processing of similar requests.
- Incremental regeneration of changed documents and tasks.

## 9. Performance Requirements

- Page load times SHALL be under 2 seconds.
- API response times SHALL meet 95th percentile of less than 200 ms.
- Document generation SHALL complete within 30 seconds.
- Task decomposition SHALL complete within 15 seconds.

## 10. Error Handling

- IF AI API calls fail, THEN THE system SHALL fallback to cached or curated responses.
- IF network latency is high, THEN THE system SHALL present degraded offline views.
- IF user inputs are invalid, THEN THE system SHALL prompt for corrections with clear errors.
- THE system SHALL log all errors for admin review.

## 11. Security & Compliance

Covered in dedicated documents; integrate security best practices as detailed.

## 12. Summary

FlowSphere backend requires a rich set of business logic and workflows enabling automated ideation, documentation, task management, AI IDE extensibility, collaboration, cost control, performance, and robustness. This specification clearly defines WHAT must be done to guide implementation.
