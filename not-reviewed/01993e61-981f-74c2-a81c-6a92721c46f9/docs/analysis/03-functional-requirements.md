# FlowSphere Functional Requirements and Business Specifications

## 1. Overview

FlowSphere is an AI-powered 360Â° project management SaaS platform that transforms user ideas into executable software projects through conversational ideation, detailed documentation generation, granular task decomposition, AI IDE integration, and efficient team collaboration. Its goal is to enable rapid, cost-effective, and context-preserving AI-assisted development workflows that overcome current limitations such as AI IDE memory loss and token cost explosion.

### Business Model

- FlowSphere addresses the growing demand for AI-driven software development tools that automate planning, documentation, and task management.
- It targets AI-first development teams, freelancers, hackathon groups, and enterprises wishing to accelerate project delivery while reducing documentation overhead and AI usage costs.
- The platform's core value proposition is seamless project transformation from idea to execution with persistent project memory and cost-optimized AI integration.

## 2. Project Ideation Workflow

### User Interaction

WHEN a user submits a new project idea (brief or detailed), THE system SHALL engage the user in a conversational brainstorming session to refine project scope, identify key features, and assess feasibility.

THE system SHALL employ AI-driven analysis to automatically extract core project requirements, risks, and technology stack recommendations based on user input.

### Business Rules

- WHEN the ideation session begins, THE system SHALL create a persistent conversational context associated with the project.
- THE system SHALL allow iterative user refinement of ideas with context preservation.

### Performance

- THE system SHALL deliver initial refined feature extraction results within 5 seconds.

## 3. Document Generation Pipeline

### Core Documents

THE system SHALL automatically generate the following project documentation types:

- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) structure
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Application Design Document (ADD)
- Technical Design Document (TDD)
- API Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Database Design Document (DDD)
- Security Architecture Document (SAD)
- Deployment Guides and Runbooks
- User Experience Document (UXD)
- UI Specifications and Design System
- Test Plans and QA Strategy
- Release Plans and Roadmaps
- Performance Requirements
- Monitoring and Observability Plans
- Business Logic Documentation
- Integration Specifications
- Compliance and Legal Requirements

### Generation and Updates

WHEN a project is created or updated, THE system SHALL generate or regenerate selected documentation in real-time or on-demand.

THE system SHALL support selective generation allowing users to choose specific documents to create or update.

THE system SHALL maintain version histories for all documents, tracking changes with ability to view diffs.

THE system SHALL export documentation in PDF, Markdown, Notion, Confluence, and Jira-compatible formats.

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL synchronize document contents automatically with changes in the project plan and task statuses.
- Visual diagrams such as ERDs, flowcharts, and architecture diagrams SHALL be auto-generated and embedded in relevant documents.

### Performance

- THE system SHALL generate or update a full set of documents within 30 seconds.

## 4. Task Decomposition Engine

### Decomposition Levels

THE system SHALL decompose projects into multi-level task hierarchies:

- Epic (major feature or module)
- Task (feature implementation)
- Mini-task (component work)
- Micro-task (single-function/method implementations)
- Atomic task (minimal atomic code changes)

### Task Attributes

- THE system SHALL assign role-specific tasks aligned with project roles, such as Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, DevOps Engineer, QA Engineer, UI/UX Designer, and AI Specialist.

- Tasks SHALL include estimated effort, dependencies, acceptance criteria, and AI-generated optimized prompts for AI IDE consumption.

- THE system SHALL package all necessary contextual information with each task to support AI IDE development.

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL update task statuses automatically based on AI IDE progress feedback and manual updates.
- THE system SHALL enable dependency mapping with clear prerequisite visualization.

### Performance

- Task breakdown and prompt generation SHALL be completed within 15 seconds for projects up to enterprise scale.

## 5. AI IDE Integration

### MCP Server Protocol

THE system SHALL implement the MCP server protocol to provide real-time context sharing and synchronization with supported AI IDEs such as Cursor AI, Codeium, GitHub Copilot, and others.

### Features

- Real-time project state synchronization to the AI IDE
- Automatic task progress updates based on IDE activity
- Smart task suggestion and prioritization
- Automated code quality gates and review triggers
- Live synchronization of documentation changes with code
- Real-time team notifications on progress and blockers

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL support pluggable IDE integrations to accommodate emerging AI tools.

### Performance

- Sync latency SHALL not exceed 2 seconds for real-time collaboration.

## 6. Context Management

### Persistent Project Memory

THE system SHALL maintain a comprehensive project memory capturing:

- Complete conversational history and ideation timeline
- Decision rationale and change logs
- Code and architecture evolution
- Performance baseline and bug fix patterns

### Context Compression

THE system SHALL implement smart summarization and relevance scoring to compress historical context while preserving critical information.

THE system SHALL budget token usage dynamically to optimize AI model interaction costs.

### Performance

- Context loading SHALL be progressive, ensuring only necessary context is loaded per task.

## 7. Team Collaboration

### Role-Based Coordination

THE system SHALL assign tasks based on team member expertise, role, and workload balancing.

THE system SHALL provide dashboards for project managers and tech leads to monitor timelines, budgets, and risk.

### Features

- Daily standup automation generating progress summaries
- Visual dependency graphs to highlight blocking tasks
- Automatic routing of code reviews to relevant team members
- Knowledge capture and sharing functionalities

### Business Rules

- THE system SHALL prevent over-allocation of tasks to any team member.
- THE system SHALL allow manual role reassignment by authorized project managers.

## 8. Cost Optimization

### Token Efficiency

THE system SHALL reduce AI token usage by 60-80% through:

- Context caching and reuse
- Dynamic AI model selection based on task complexity
- Batch processing of similar requests
- Incremental document and task regeneration

## 9. Performance Requirements

- Page loads SHALL be under 2 seconds.
- API responses SHALL meet P95 latency of less than 200ms in safe mode.
- Document generation SHALL complete within 30 seconds for the full documentation set.
- Task decomposition SHALL be rendered within 15 seconds.

## 10. Error Handling

- IF AI API requests fail, THEN THE system SHALL fallback to cached responses or curated sample data.
- IF network latency exceeds thresholds, THEN THE system SHALL present a degraded offline mode with local cached data.
- IF user inputs are invalid or incomplete, THEN THE system SHALL prompt for correction with clear error messages.
- THE system SHALL log all errors for monitoring and alerting.

## 11. Security & Compliance

### Authentication & Authorization

THE system SHALL support OAuth with providers like Google and GitHub.

User sessions SHALL expire after configurable periods (default 30 days).

JWT tokens SHALL be used with embedded userId, role, and permissions claims.

### Role-Based Access Control

THE system SHALL enforce permissions strictly based on defined roles.

Administrative actions SHALL be limited to admin users.

User roles SHALL be enforced for all CRUD operations on projects, tasks, and documents.

### Data Privacy

THE system SHALL comply with data protection regulations, enforcing encryption at rest and in transit.

### Audit & Monitoring

THE system SHALL log access and modification events for audit purposes.

## 12. Summary

FlowSphere's backend must deliver robust business logic enabling automated AI-driven project ideation, comprehensive documentation generation, task decomposition, AI IDE real-time collaboration, team role management, cost-efficient AI integration, and high performance with error resilience and security compliance. The requirements described specify clear, actionable functionality, error scenarios, and performance goals to guide successful implementation.
