# FlowSphere Functional Requirements and Business Specifications

## 1. Overview
FlowSphere is an AI-powered 360Â° project management SaaS platform that transforms user ideas into actionable, executable software projects. It enables conversational ideation, automated multi-document generation, detailed task decomposition, AI IDE integration, context persistence, and robust team collaboration. These requirements specify the business processes governing these capabilities to ensure consistent implementation.

### Business Model
- FlowSphere fills an essential market need for AI-native project management that overcomes AI IDE memory loss and costly token usage.
- It targets developers, freelancers, hackathon teams, and enterprises seeking efficient, automated project workflows.

## 2. Project Ideation Workflow

### User Interaction
WHEN a user submits a project idea, THE system SHALL engage in a conversational session to refine and validate the concept.
WHEN ideation begins, THE system SHALL create and store a persistent conversation history linked to the project.

### Business Rules
- THE system SHALL automatically analyze user input to extract key project requirements, technology recommendations, and risk assessments.
- THE system SHALL allow iterative user input refinement through the conversation interface.

### Performance Requirements
- THE system SHALL provide feature extraction results within 5 seconds of input.

## 3. Document Generation Pipeline

### Core Documents
THE system SHALL generate at least the following documents automatically: PRD, MVP, SRS, ADD, TDD, API documentation, DDD, SAD, deployment guides, UXD, UI specifications, test plans, release plans, performance and monitoring plans, business logic documentation, integration specs, and compliance requirements.

### Generation and Updates
- WHEN a project is created or updated, THE system SHALL generate or regenerate requested documents.
- THE system SHALL offer selective document generation per user configuration.
- THE system SHALL maintain version history for all documents with diffs viewable.
- THE system SHALL allow export in PDF, Markdown, Notion, Jira, and Confluence formats.
- THE system SHALL embed autogenerated diagrams such as ERDs and flowcharts.

### Performance Requirements
- THE system SHALL complete full document generation within 30 seconds.

## 4. Task Decomposition Engine

### Task Hierarchy
THE system SHALL decompose projects into hierarchical tasks: Epic, Task, Mini-Task, Micro-Task, and Atomic task levels.

### Task Attributes
- THE system SHALL assign tasks role-specifically (frontend, backend, QA, UI/UX, DevOps, AI specialist).
- THE system SHALL provide estimated effort, task dependencies, acceptance criteria, and AI-IDE optimized prompts.
- THE system SHALL package relevant project context with each task.

### Business Rules
- THE system SHALL update task status automatically from AI IDE feedback and manually by users.
- THE system SHALL visualize dependencies and blockages clearly.

### Performance Requirements
- Task generation and prompt creation SHALL complete within 15 seconds.

## 5. AI IDE Integration

### MCP Server Protocol
THE system SHALL implement context sharing and task synchronization with popular AI IDEs (Cursor AI, Codeium, etc.) through an MCP server protocol.

### Integration Capabilities
- Real-time state synchronization
- Automatic task progress tracking
- Smart task suggestion for developers
- Automated code-quality gating
- Real-time documentation sync
- Team progress notifications

### Performance Requirements
- Sync latency SHALL be under 2 seconds for collaboration experience.

## 6. Context Management

### Persistent Project Memory
THE system SHALL maintain comprehensive conversational histories, design decisions, code changes, bug patterns, and performance metrics.

### Context Compression
- THE system SHALL compress older context to optimize token usage without losing critical details.
- THE system SHALL prioritize context relevance dynamically per task.

### Performance Requirements
- Context loading and compression SHALL execute within 3 seconds.

## 7. Team Collaboration

### Role-Based Assignment
- THE system SHALL assign tasks based on member expertise and workload balance.
- THE system SHALL provide dashboards for managers to monitor timelines, budgets, and risks.

### Collaboration Features
- Automated daily standup report generation
- Dependency visualization for task blockers
- Automated routing of code reviews
- Knowledge sharing and lessons logging

### Business Rules
- THE system SHALL prevent task overallocation.
- THE system SHALL allow authorized manual overrides.

## 8. Cost Optimization

### Token Usage Management
- THE system SHALL reduce token consumption by 60-80% using caching, batching, and incremental updates.
- THE system SHALL select AI models dynamically based on task complexity and cost constraints.

### Development Acceleration
- THE system SHALL auto-generate boilerplate code and test suites.
- THE system SHALL provide refactoring suggestions and performance monitoring.

## 9. Performance Requirements

- The system SHALL serve UI pages within 2 seconds.
- API response times SHALL meet P95 under 200 ms.
- Document generation SHALL complete within 30 seconds.
- Task decomposition updates SHALL be rendered within 15 seconds.

## 10. Error Handling

- IF AI service calls fail, THEN THE system SHALL fallback on cached or curated data.
- IF network latency is high, THEN THE system SHALL provide offline capability with sync queue.
- IF user input fails validation, THEN THE system SHALL display detailed error messages.
- ALL system errors SHALL be logged and monitored.

## 11. Security & Compliance

### Authentication
THE system SHALL support OAuth 2.0 and email-based logins with secure session handling.

### Authorization
THE system SHALL enforce role-based access control strictly.

### Data Protection
- THE system SHALL encrypt data at rest and in transit.
- Data deletion SHALL be performed on user request within 30 days.

### Audit
Activity logging and monitoring SHALL cover security and operational events.

## 12. Summary

FlowSphere's backend business requirements ensure a comprehensive AI-powered project management platform offering automated ideation, documentation, task management, AI IDE integration, team collaboration, and cost-efficient development with robust security and error handling.
