# FlowSphere Backend Business Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
FlowSphere is an AI-powered 360Â° project management SaaS platform designed to automate the entire software development lifecycle from ideation through execution with AI integration. This document specifies the complete backend business requirements necessary for the development team to build the system precisely as intended.

## 2. Business Model
### 2.1 Business Justification
FlowSphere addresses the limitations of existing AI-assisted development workflows, including context loss in AI IDEs, excessive token costs, manual documentation overhead, inconsistent task management, and poor team coordination. It fills a unique market gap by offering a persistent, cost-optimized, and fully integrated AI-native project management platform.

### 2.2 Business Strategy
The platform will operate under a tiered subscription model to generate revenue, targeting AI-first teams, freelancers, hackathon participants, bootcamp students, and enterprises. It plans user acquisition through targeted marketing, community engagement, and partnerships.

### 2.3 Business Operations
Core offerings include:
- Conversational AI-driven project ideation and refinement
- Automated generation of comprehensive project documentation
- Granular task breakdowns with role-based assignments
- Real-time AI IDE integration via MCP protocol
- Persistent project memory with context compression
- Cost-efficient AI usage with smart token management
- Advanced team collaboration and workload balancing features

## 3. User Roles and Authentication
### 3.1 User Roles
FlowSphere supports the following roles with distinct capabilities:
- Guest: View public content and register

- QA Engineer: Plan and execute tests
- UI/UX Designer: Design interfaces and experiences
- AI Specialist: Manage AI tasks and prompts
- Administrator: Full system control

### 3.2 Authentication Workflow
- User registration with email verification
- Secure login with JWT session tokens
- Logout and token revocation
- Password reset and change mechanisms

### 3.3 Token Management
- Use JWT tokens with 15-minute access and 14-day refresh expirations
- Store tokens securely with CSRF protections
- Rotate keys periodically

### 3.4 Permissions Matrix
Permissions are enforced based on roles, restricting actions such as project creation, task assignments, and administrative operations.

## 4. Core Functional Requirements
### 4.1 Project Ideation
- Support conversational project idea submissions
- AI-powered feature extraction and feasibility analysis

### 4.2 Document Generation
- Automatically produce 18+ document types including PRD, SRS, MVP, ADD, API docs, etc.
- Enable selective document generation and version control
- Support export to multiple formats

### 4.3 Task Decomposition
- Break projects into epics, tasks, mini-tasks, micro-tasks, and atomic tasks
- Assign tasks based on user roles and expertise
- Generate AI-optimized prompts for tasks

### 4.4 AI IDE Integration
- Implement MCP server for real-time context sharing
- Sync task progress and project state with IDE
- Support multiple IDEs with extensible integration

### 4.5 Context Management
- Maintain project conversation histories and decision logs
- Compress context data for token efficiency
- Load context progressively per task need

### 4.6 Team Collaboration
- Role-based task assignments and workload balancing
- Provide dashboards for project management and progress
- Automate daily standups and notifications

### 4.7 Cost Optimization
- Reduce AI token consumption through caching and batch processing
- Dynamically select AI models based on task complexity

### 4.8 Performance
- Ensure page load times under 2 seconds
- API responses with P95 latency < 200ms
- Document and task generation within defined SLAs

## 5. Business Rules and Validation
- Enforce role-based access for all CRUD operations
- Validate task dependencies and status changes
- Handle AI failure modes with fallbacks

## 6. Error Handling
- Provide clear, actionable error messages
- Retry strategies for failed operations
- Document generation and task update fallbacks

## 7. Security and Compliance
### 7.1 Data Privacy and Encryption
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Comply with GDPR and CCPA

### 7.2 RBAC
- Strict enforcement of permissions
- Unauthorized access returns 403

### 7.3 Audit Logging
- Log all critical events and changes

### 7.4 Incident Response
- Detection, alerting, and remediation

## 8. External Integrations
- AI model providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.
- MCP server protocol for AI IDEs
- OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
- Notification and storage services

## 9. Data Flows and Event Processing
- Event-driven architecture
- Role-based data access control

## 10. Summary
This specification thoroughly defines FlowSphere's backend business requirements, providing developers with clear, actionable instructions to implement a scalable, secure, and efficient AI-native project management system.
