# FlowSphere Backend Business Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction
This specification defines the complete business requirements for the FlowSphere platform backend. FlowSphere is an AI-powered SaaS platform that automates project ideation, documentation, task decomposition, and AI IDE integration to enable efficient, cost-optimized team collaboration and development.

---

## 2. Business Model

### 2.1 Why FlowSphere Exists
WHEN software development teams use existing AI IDEs, THE system SHALL encounter loss of context due to token limits, leading to inefficient code generation, duplicated effort, and increased operational costs.

WHEN project documentation is manually maintained, THE system SHALL incur overhead reducing developer productivity.

WHEN distributed teams undertake development without unified tools, THE system SHALL face coordination friction impacting delivery timelines.

FlowSphere addresses these issues through persistent context preservation, automated document generation, AI-native task management, and real-time IDE integration.

### 2.2 Revenue Model
FlowSphere SHALL monetize through subscription plans, tiered based on AI usage, feature access, and team size.

Premium features SHALL include advanced AI models, extended context retention, and enterprise integrations.

### 2.3 Growth Strategy
FlowSphere SHALL target AI-first teams, freelancers, hackathons, and enterprises adopting AI in development workflows.

Customer acquisition SHALL leverage digital marketing, strategic partnerships, and developer community engagement.

## 3. User Roles and Authentication

### 3.1 User Roles Description
- **Guest:** Access public marketing content only.
- **Registered User:** Create/manage personal projects, participate in tasks.
- **Project Manager:** Create projects, assign roles, manage timelines.
- **Frontend Developer:** Execute UI tasks.
- **Backend Developer:** Handle server-side tasks.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Manage deployment and infrastructure.
- **QA Engineer:** Plan and execute testing.
- **UI/UX Designer:** Design and review interfaces.
- **AI Specialist:** Manage AI prompts and context memory.
- **Administrator:** Full system control and user management.

### 3.2 Authentication Requirements
WHEN a new user registers, THE system SHALL validate all input data and initiate email verification.

WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL authenticate credentials and generate JWT tokens with embedded role and permission claims.

WHEN a user logs out, THE system SHALL revoke tokens and terminate sessions.

Sessions SHALL expire after 30 minutes of inactivity.

### 3.3 Token Usage
JWT tokens SHALL include user ID, roles, permissions, issued-at, and expiration claims.

Refresh tokens SHALL allow session renewal, with expiration at 14 days.

### 3.4 Role-Based Authorization
THE system SHALL enforce access controls using role definitions ensuring users can only perform authorized actions.

### 3.5 Permission Matrix
| Action | Guest | Registered User | Project Manager | Frontend Dev | Backend Dev | DevOps | QA Engineer | UI/UX Designer | AI Specialist | Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 4. Project Ideation Workflow

WHEN a user submits a project idea, THE system SHALL parse the input through conversational AI to refine requirements.

THE system SHALL preserve complete ideation context linked to the project for use throughout its lifecycle.

THE system SHALL generate initial project blueprints including MVP structure and technology stack recommendations within 5 seconds.

---

## 5. Automated Documentation

THE system SHALL produce and maintain the following documents automatically for each project:
- Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Minimum Viable Product structure (MVP)
- Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
- Application Design Document (ADD)
- Test and QA Plans
- API Documentation
- Database Design Documentation
- Deployment Guides
- Security Architecture
- Compliance and Legal Documents

THE system SHALL allow selective document generation and provide versioning with differential views.

THE system SHALL export documents in PDF, Markdown, Notion, and Jira-compatible formats.

THE system SHALL update generated documentation in real-time as projects evolve.

---

## 6. Task Management and Decomposition

THE system SHALL decompose projects into hierarchical task levels: Epic, Task, Mini, Micro, Atomic.

THE system SHALL assign tasks based on user role, expertise, and workload balance.

THE system SHALL generate AI-optimized prompts for micro and atomic tasks to guide AI IDE interactions.

THE system SHALL map task dependencies and visualize blocking relationships.

THE system SHALL auto-update task status from IDE progress and allow manual overrides.

---

## 7. AI IDE Integration and MCP Server

THE system SHALL implement MCP protocol for bi-directional real-time context sharing with AI IDEs.

THE system SHALL support AI IDEs such as Cursor AI, Codeium, GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, and others.

MCP integration SHALL include task progress tracking, smart suggestions, code quality gates, and real-time documentation sync.

THE system SHALL authenticate IDE clients per user and project permissions.

---

## 8. Persistent Project Context and Memory

THE system SHALL maintain a persistent project memory capturing conversation history, decision rationale, code evolution, and architecture changes.

THE system SHALL implement context compression techniques to optimize AI token usage while preserving critical information.

THE system SHALL load context progressively per task requirements.

---

## 9. Team Collaboration and Coordination

THE system SHALL assign tasks automatically according to role, skill, and availability.

THE system SHALL provide dashboards for monitoring timelines, budgets, and risks.

THE system SHALL automate daily standups and status summaries.

THE system SHALL visualize dependencies and highlight blockers.

THE system SHALL provide notification mechanisms for team updates and critical events.

THE system SHALL enable knowledge sharing and document commenting.

---

## 10. Token Usage Optimization

THE system SHALL reduce AI token consumption by 60-80% using caching, batch processing, and incremental updates.

THE system SHALL dynamically select AI models appropriate to task complexity and token budgets.

THE system SHALL reuse computed context and AI responses when applicable.
