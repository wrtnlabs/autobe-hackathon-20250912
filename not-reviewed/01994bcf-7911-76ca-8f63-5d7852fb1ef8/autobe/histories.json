Introduction\n\nThis document presents a comprehensive analysis of the business requirements for the Subscription & Renewal Guardian service. The purpose is to provide a clear, detailed foundation for backend developers to implement the system that manages personal subscription tracking and renewal reminders effectively.\n\nThe service aims to help users monitor their various subscriptions and upcoming renewals, reducing missed payments and ensuring better subscription management.\n\n## 2. Business Model\n\n### Why This Service Exists\n\nThe Subscription & Renewal Guardian service addresses the widespread problem of users losing track of their numerous personal subscriptions due to a fragmented and manual management process. Many users face unexpected charges when subscriptions auto-renew without their awareness, leading to dissatisfaction and potential financial issues.\n\nThis service fills a niche by providing a centralized, easy-to-use platform for tracking subscriptions and notifying users of upcoming renewals. This reduces subscription fatigue and increases user control over their recurring expenses.\n\n### Revenue Strategy\n\nAlthough the current system focuses on personal use without direct monetization, possible revenue strategies include offering premium features such as enhanced analytics, multiple user profiles, or integration with payment systems. The initial emphasis is on user acquisition and retention through reliable, accurate subscription tracking.\n\n### Growth Plan\n\nUser acquisition will rely on the value of subscription management and potential integrations with other personal finance tools. Retention will be driven by timely, accurate reminders and an intuitive platform that encourages continued use.\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n- Monthly Active Users (MAU)\n- Subscription count per user\n- Renewal reminder accuracy\n- User retention rate over 6 and 12 months\n\n## 3. User Roles and Permissions\n\nThe service defines two user roles with distinct access levels:\n\n### User\n- Authenticated individual users who can create, read, update, and delete their own vendors and subscriptions. Allowed to manage their personal data and track renewals.\n\n### Admin\n- System administrators with read-only global oversight. They can view all user data but cannot modify any user or subscription information.\n\nPermissions Summary:\n| Action                        | User | Admin |\n|-------------------------------|:----:|:-----:|\n| Create subscription/vendor     |  ✅  |   ❌  |\n| Read own subscriptions/vendors |  ✅  |   ❌  |\n| Read all subscriptions/vendors |  ❌  |   ✅  |\n| Update own subscriptions/vendors | ✅  |   ❌  |\n| Delete own subscriptions/vendors | ✅  |   ❌  |\n| Modify any subscription status  | ✅  |   ❌  |\n\nAuthentication is based on JWT tokens issued on successful email and password login.\nNo refresh tokens are implemented; tokens have fixed expirations.\nUser credentials must be verified on signup and login with appropriate validation.\n\n## 4. Functional Requirements\n\n### Vendor Management\n- Users can create new vendor records with unique vendor names (case-insensitive, trimmed).\n- Vendor names must be unique across the system using case-insensitive (citext) comparison.\n- Users can update vendor details but cannot delete vendors.\n- System should prevent duplicate vendors and return a 409 conflict error if a duplicate is attempted.\n\n### Subscription Management\n- Users can add subscriptions linked to vendors with fields including plan name, amount (decimal >=0), currency code (ISO-4217 uppercase), billing cycle (enum set), start date, status, and next renewal date.\n- Subscriptions are unique per (user_id, vendor_id, plan_name).\n- System computes and persists next renewal date on creation and updates when billing cycle or start date changes.\n- Status can be ACTIVE, PAUSED, or CANCELED. PAUSED freezes renewal computations; RESUME must recalculate the next renewal date to be strictly in the future.\n- Users can update subscription details unless status is CANCELED (terminal state). Attempts to modify canceled subscriptions must return a 409 error.\n\n### Reminders\n- Users can create and manage reminders tied to their subscriptions.\n- Reminders help notify users prior to renewals but should align with subscription states.\n\n### Upcoming Renewals\n- System provides an endpoint to query subscriptions renewing within a configurable number of days (default 30, range 1 to 365).\n- Only ACTIVE subscriptions are included; PAUSED and CANCELED subscriptions are excluded.\n- Results are sorted ascending by the next renewal date.\n\n## 5. Business Rules and Validation\n\n- All date-time fields are stored as UTC; business logic uses timezone Asia/Seoul.\n- Vendor names are trimmed on input and enforced unique case-insensitively.\n- Amounts in subscriptions must be non-negative decimals, validated at the service layer.\n- Attempts to create duplicates at vendor or subscription level cause a 409 conflict error.\n- Status transitions from CANCELED are forbidden; modifications return 409 conflict.\n- Pausing a subscription freezes next renewal date; resuming recalculates the next renewal date until strictly > now.\n\n## 6. Error Handling Scenarios\n\n- Duplicate vendor creation attempts return HTTP 409 with an appropriate message.\n- Duplicate subscription creation attempts return HTTP 409.\n- Invalid amounts or currency codes result in HTTP 400 Bad Request with error details.\n- Unauthorized access to another user's data results in HTTP 403 Forbidden.\n- Attempts to modify canceled subscription entries respond with 409 Conflict.\n- Missing or invalid JWT tokens result in HTTP 401 Unauthorized.\n\n## 7. Performance Expectations\n\n- All user-facing API responses shall complete within 2 seconds under standard load.\n- Queries for upcoming renewals return paginated results sorted by renewal date.\n- Data consistency on creation and update operations shall be ensured through transactional integrity.\n\n## 8. Summary\n\nThis analysis comprehensively captures the Subscription & Renewal Guardian's functional and business requirements, clarifies user roles, and enumerates validation and error handling rules. It lays a solid foundation for the subsequent detailed design, schema development, API specification, testing, and implementation phases.\n\n---\n\nThis document provides business requirements only.

Introduction\n\n### 1.1 Background and Purpose\n\nThis document defines the detailed business rules, constraints, and validation logic for the Subscription & Renewal Guardian service, which enables users to track personal subscriptions and upcoming renewals. It translates business needs and requirements into precise mandates that backend developers shall implement to ensure system correctness and reliability.\n\n### 1.2 Scope\n\nThis document focuses exclusively on the business logic governing vendor management, subscription lifecycle, renewal scheduling, state transitions, validation and error handling relevant to the subscription tracking domain. It does not cover technical implementation details, database schemas, or API specifications, which are addressed in separate documents.\n\n## 2. Business Model Overview\n\nThe Subscription & Renewal Guardian service fills a critical market need by helping users efficiently manage their recurring subscriptions and avoid accidental service lapses or unexpected charges. It differentiates itself by providing personalized subscription tracking with proactive renewal monitoring within a secure authenticated environment.\n\nRevenue is derived primarily by monetizing premium features such as enhanced notification and reminder customizations, with user growth driven by simple onboarding and maximizing user retention through accurate renewal tracking.\n\nKey success metrics include Monthly Active Users (MAU), renewal adherence rates, and subscription data completeness.\n\n## 3. User Roles and Permissions\n\n### Roles:\n- **User:** Authenticated individuals who can create, read, update, and delete their own subscription and vendor data. They manage their personal subscription lifecycle, including adding reminders and viewing upcoming renewal notifications.\n- **Admin:** System administrators with read-only access across all users’ subscription and vendor data, enabling global monitoring and oversight.\n\n### Permissions:\n- Users shall only modify their own data.\n- Admins shall have no modification privileges.\n\n## 4. Core Business Rules for Vendors\n\n- Vendor names are stored as trimmed, case-insensitive unique values enforced by PostgreSQL `citext`.\n- No two vendors can exist with names differing only in case or trailing/leading spaces.\n- Users can create and update vendors with names complying with uniqueness constraints.\n- Vendor deletion is not permitted.\n\n## 5. Core Business Rules for Subscriptions\n\n- Subscriptions belong exclusively to a single user and link to a specific vendor.\n- Each subscription must define a plan name that, combined with user and vendor IDs, is unique.\n- Valid billing cycles are enumerated as DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, or YEARLY.\n- Amounts must be decimals with two decimal places and non-negative.\n- Currency codes must conform to ISO-4217 three-letter uppercase format.\n- Subscription statuses are enumerated as ACTIVE, PAUSED, or CANCELED; once CANCELED, further modifications are forbidden.\n\n## 6. Subscription Renewal Logic\n\n- The system shall persist `next_renewal_at` as a computed date-time stored in UTC.\n- Upon subscription creation or update, if `billing_cycle` or `started_at` change and status is not PAUSED or CANCELED, the system SHALL recompute `next_renewal_at` according to the billing cycle starting from the subscription start date or the latest renewal date.\n- WHEN a subscription is paused, THE system SHALL freeze `next_renewal_at`; no updates occur.\n- WHEN a subscription is resumed from PAUSED, THE system SHALL recalculate `next_renewal_at` forward from the current UTC time to the next renewal date strictly greater than now.\n\n## 7. Subscription State Management\n\n- ACTIVE subscriptions represent normal recurring status.\n- PAUSED subscriptions halt renewal date progression but retain all other subscription data; no recomputation of renewal occurs.\n- CANCELED subscriptions are terminal; no further modifications (update, pause, resume) shall be allowed.\n\n## 8. Data Validation and Uniqueness Constraints\n\n- Vendor name uniqueness is enforced case-insensitively and trimmed.\n- Subscription uniqueness combines user ID, vendor ID, and plan name.\n- Subscription amount must be >= 0.\n- Currency values must be valid ISO-4217 codes (3 uppercase letters).\n- Billing cycle and subscription status accept only predefined enum values.\n- Attempts at duplicates (vendor name or subscription tuple) must result in HTTP 409 Conflict errors at the API layer.\n\n## 9. Error Handling Rules\n\n- Duplicate vendor name submissions shall be rejected with a 409 Conflict and descriptive error.\n- Duplicate subscription lifecycle attempts (same user, vendor, plan) shall also trigger 409 Conflict errors.\n- Modifications to CANCELED subscriptions shall be blocked with 409 Conflict error.\n- Unauthorized access triggers 401 or 403 errors as appropriate.\n- Non-existent resources yield 404 Not Found error.\n\n## 10. Performance Expectations\n\n- Business rules executions should enable real-time response for subscription updates, renewals, and queries.\n- Upcoming renewal queries filtered by date ranges shall perform efficiently with appropriate indexing.\n\n## 11. Summary\n\nThis document comprehensively defines the binding business rules shaping vendor and subscription data handling within the Subscription & Renewal Guardian. It outlines precise validation, lifecycle management, and error conditions vital for the backend implementation to meet the service’s functional and operational standards.\n\n---\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  A[\"User Creates/Updates Vendor\"] --> B{\"Is vendor name unique?\"}\n  B -- \"Yes\" --> C[\"Vendor saved\"]\n  B -- \"No\" --> D[\"409 Conflict Error\"]\n\n  E[\"User Creates/Updates Subscription\"] --> F{\"Is subscription unique?\"}\n  F -- \"No\" --> D\n  F -- \"Yes\" --> G{\"Subscription status\"}\n  G -- \"ACTIVE or PAUSED\" --> H[\"Compute or freeze next_renewal_at\"]\n  G -- \"CANCELED\" --> D\n\n  I[\"User Pauses Subscription\"] --> J[\"Freeze next_renewal_at\"]\n  K[\"User Resumes Subscription\"] --> L[\"Recompute next_renewal_at > now\"]\n\n  M[\"User Queries Upcoming Renewals\"] --> N[\"Filter ACTIVE subscriptions\"]\n  N --> O[\"Sort by next_renewal_at ASC\"]\n\n  B ==> C\n  F ==> G\n  H --> F\n  J --> F\n  L --> F\n```\n\nThis document provides business requirements only.

Introduction\n\nThe Subscription & Renewal Guardian service is designed to empower users to manage their personal subscriptions and to monitor upcoming renewals efficiently. It addresses the common pain points of losing track of recurring payments and unexpected charges by providing timely reminders and clear subscription statuses.\n\nThis document outlines the concise requirements for the backend system, translating the business goals, user roles, workflows, and constraints into a comprehensive analysis aimed at backend developers.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Business Model Overview\n\n### Why This Service Exists\n\nModern consumers often subscribe to numerous services ranging from streaming platforms to SaaS tools but lack a unified system to track the multiple renewal cycles and costs. Subscription & Renewal Guardian fills this gap by providing a centralized subscription management service.\n\n### Revenue Strategy\n\nThough the initial focus is on user tooling, potential future monetization may involve premium features or partnerships with vendors; however, this document focuses on core subscription tracking capabilities.\n\n### Success Metrics\n\n- User retention measured by active subscription tracking\n- Accuracy of upcoming renewals notifications\n- Prevention of duplicate subscription entries\n- Stable authentication and secure access\n\n---\n\n## 3. User Roles and Permissions\n\n### Roles Defined\n\n- **User**: Authenticated individuals who can create, read, update, and delete their own subscription and vendor data. Users manage their personal subscriptions, track renewal dates, and receive reminders.\n\n- **Admin**: Read-only access to all subscriptions and vendors globally across users for administrative oversight. Cannot modify user data.\n\n### Permission Matrix\n\n| Action                    | User | Admin |\n|---------------------------|:----:|:-----:|\n| CRUD own subscriptions    | ✅   | ❌    |\n| CRUD own vendors          | ✅   | ❌    |\n| Read all subscriptions    | ❌   | ✅    |\n| Read all vendors          | ❌   | ✅    |\n| Modify others’ data       | ❌   | ❌    |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Functional Requirements Summary\n\n- Users authenticate using JWT (email+password), with no refresh tokens.\n- Users can create vendors with unique, trimmed, case-insensitive names.\n- Users can add subscriptions tied uniquely by user_id, vendor_id, and plan_name.\n- Subscription fields include amount (validated >=0), billing cycle (DAILY, WEEKLY, MONTHLY, YEARLY), status (ACTIVE, PAUSED, CANCELED), next_renewal_at (UTC), and started_at.\n- next_renewal_at is recalculated on create/update when relevant fields change.\n- PAUSED subscriptions freeze next_renewal_at; RESUMED subscriptions recompute next_renewal_at to strictly after current UTC time.\n- The system returns upcoming subscriptions renewing within a configurable window (default 30 days), excluding PAUSED and CANCELED, ordered ascending by next_renewal_at.\n- Attempts to create duplicate vendors or subscriptions yield HTTP 409 Conflict.\n- Canceling a subscription makes it terminal; further modifications yield HTTP 409.\n- Standard HTTP 401/403/404 errors apply for unauthorized access or missing resources.\n- Vendors cannot be deleted.\n- Reminders nested under subscriptions support basic CRUD operations for user convenience.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Business Rules and Constraints\n\n- Vendor names are unique globally via case-insensitive comparison (citext) and trimmed on input.\n- Subscription uniqueness enforced by a tuple of user_id, vendor_id, and plan_name.\n- Amount field must always be decimal with scale 2 and non-negative.\n- Currency codes must conform to ISO-4217 three-letter uppercase format.\n- Subscription statuses are enumerated as ACTIVE, PAUSED, or CANCELED; once CANCELED, further modifications are forbidden.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Subscription Renewal Logic\n\n- The system shall persist `next_renewal_at` as a computed date-time stored in UTC.\n- Upon subscription creation or update, if `billing_cycle` or `started_at` change and status is not PAUSED or CANCELED, the system SHALL recompute `next_renewal_at` according to the billing cycle starting from the subscription start date or the latest renewal date.\n- WHEN a subscription is paused, THE system SHALL freeze `next_renewal_at`; no updates occur.\n- WHEN a subscription is resumed from PAUSED, THE system SHALL recalculate `next_renewal_at` forward from the current UTC time to the next renewal date strictly greater than now.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Error Handling\n\n- Duplicate vendor name submissions shall be rejected with a 409 Conflict and descriptive error.\n- Duplicate subscription lifecycle attempts (same user, vendor, plan) shall also trigger 409 Conflict errors.\n- Modifications to CANCELED subscriptions shall be blocked with 409 Conflict error.\n- Unauthorized or forbidden access attempts shall respond with 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden as applicable.\n- Requests for non-existent resources return 404 Not Found.\n- Invalid input for amounts (e.g., negative decimals) or bad currency codes return 400 Bad Request.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Performance Expectations\n\nThe system SHALL respond to all user interactions within 2 seconds in typical scenarios, ensuring a smooth user experience.\n\nEndpoints returning paginated listings SHALL support offset and limit parameters to maintain performance.\n\nQueries for upcoming renewals SHALL execute efficiently with proper indexing on user_id and next_renewal_at.\n\n---\n\n## 9.

Summary\n\nThe Subscription & Renewal Guardian backend service requires strict enforcement of business rules for subscription lifecycle management, uniqueness constraints, renewal computations, and access control by defined roles. The system shall provide clear error responses to guide users and maintain data integrity.\n\nAuthentication shall use JWT tokens and enforce role-based permissions strictly. Renewals computations must be consistent with the configured billing cycle and respect PAUSED and CANCELED statuses.\n\nThis document provides business requirements only.
