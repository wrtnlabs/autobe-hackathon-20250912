/**
 * Delete a privacy setting record by ID.
 *
 * This API endpoint allows authorized authenticated members or admins to
 * permanently delete a specific privacy setting by its unique identifier from
 * the travel_record_privacy_settings table.
 *
 * The table stores privacy configurations controlling visibility of travel
 * records, enabling users to restrict access to their data as 'public' or
 * 'private'.
 *
 * The operation requires the 'id' path parameter in UUID format specifying the
 * privacy setting to be deleted.
 *
 * Security checks ensure that only the owner member or an administrator can
 * perform this deletion.
 *
 * If the provided 'id' does not exist or the caller lacks permissions, the API
 * will respond with appropriate error messages and status codes.
 *
 * This operation does not require any request body nor returns a response body.
 *
 * Related operations include creation, retrieval, and updating of privacy
 * settings.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.id Unique identifier of the privacy setting record to delete
 * @path /travelRecord/member/privacySettings/:id
 * @accessor api.functional.travelRecord.member.privacySettings.erase
