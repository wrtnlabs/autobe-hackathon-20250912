   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of travel record places from the
   * system's database. This operation supports advanced query parameters such
   * as location bounding boxes, date ranges, and text matching via search
   * filters operating on travel_record_places records.
   *
   * Security considerations enforce that only authenticated members with
   * "member" role can retrieve lists of places. Public access is not granted
   * to this operation due to privacy and data sensitivity.
   *
   * The operation maps directly to the travel_record_places table as defined
   * in the Prisma schema, which includes fields like latitude, longitude,
   * visit_date, place_name, and google_place_id. All response data reflects
   * only existing places with respect to soft deletion (deleted_at not null
   * means excluded).
   *
   * Validation ensures input parameters meet expected formats and types.
   * Pagination and sorting parameters control response size and order. Errors
   * in input formats or unauthorized access result in appropriate error
   * responses.
   *
   * Related operations that might be used with this include viewing details
   * of a single place (GET /places/{id}), creating new place records (POST
   * /places), and updating existing ones (PUT /places/{id}).
   *
   * This operation does not support deleting place records as per system
   * design constraints.
