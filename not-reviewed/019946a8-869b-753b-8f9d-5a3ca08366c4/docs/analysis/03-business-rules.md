# TravelRecord Backend Business Rules and Security Requirements

This document provides the complete business rules, validation logic, error handling processes, security standards, data privacy measures, and audit logging requirements for the TravelRecord backend system.

All requirements focus exclusively on business rules and user-oriented specifications. Technical architecture, API specifications, and data schema design are outside the scope of this document and remain at the discretion of the development team.

---

## 1. Business Rules and Validation

### 1.1 User Authentication and Authorization Rules

- WHEN a user attempts to authenticate, THE system SHALL validate OAuth tokens through Google OAuth provider.
- WHEN authentication succeeds, THE system SHALL create a session for the user and associate their role accordingly.
- WHEN authentication fails due to invalid or expired tokens, THE system SHALL respond with an authentication error.
- THE system SHALL assign roles based on authenticated user identity to enforce access control.
- THE system SHALL prevent unauthenticated users (guests) from creating, editing, or sharing travel records.

### 1.2 Place Recording and Review Management Rules

- WHEN a member submits a new visited place record, THE system SHALL require a valid Google Maps location identifier or geolocation coordinates.
- THE system SHALL allow members to upload multiple photos per place record.
- THE system SHALL require a star rating for each review associated with a place, with values restricted to integers from 1 through 5.
- THE system SHALL permit members to write textual reviews associated with each visited place.
- THE system SHALL allow editing or deleting of a member's review and photos within the record.

### 1.3 Photo Upload and Data Management Rules

- THE system SHALL validate image file types and sizes according to configured limits.
- THE system SHALL store uploaded photos securely and associate them with the correct place record.
- THE system SHALL ensure photo data is retrievable by authorized users according to sharing and privacy settings.

### 1.4 Friend and Sharing Privacy Rules

- THE system SHALL allow members to add or remove friends within the system.
- THE system SHALL allow members to share place and review records with friends.
- THE system SHALL enforce sharing permissions based on privacy settings per record.
- WHERE a record is set as "public," THE system SHALL make the record visible to all friends and optionally, other members where applicable.
- WHERE a record is set as "private," THE system SHALL restrict visibility to only the record owner.

### 1.5 Data Integrity and Consistency Rules

- THE system SHALL prevent duplicate place records for the same user unless explicitly allowed.
- THE system SHALL maintain referential integrity between users, records, photos, reviews, and friendships.
- THE system SHALL log creation, update, and deletion timestamps on all records.


## 2. Error Handling Scenarios

### 2.1 Authentication and Authorization Errors

- IF a user attempts to access data without a valid session, THEN THE system SHALL return an error indicating unauthorized access.
- IF Google OAuth token validation fails, THEN THE system SHALL reject the login attempt and provide an informative message.

### 2.2 Data Validation and Input Errors

- IF submitted place location data is invalid or missing, THEN THE system SHALL reject the record creation with a descriptive error.
- IF photo uploads exceed size or format limits, THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload and notify the user.
- IF star rating values are outside the accepted scale (1â€“5), THEN THE system SHALL reject the review submission with validation error.

### 2.3 Sharing and Privacy Conflict Errors

- IF a user attempts to view a private record without ownership, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and log the incident.
- IF a sharing change operation conflicts with existing friend relationships, THEN THE system SHALL enforce business rules regarding sharing visibility.

### 2.4 System and Operational Errors

- IF any unexpected system error occurs, THEN THE system SHALL return a generic error message, log detailed error info, and notify administrators.
- IF database operation fails, THEN THE system SHALL roll back the transaction and notify the user of failure.

## 3. Security and Compliance

### 3.1 Authentication via Google OAuth

- THE system SHALL enforce OAuth 2.0 standards for authentication.
- THE system SHALL securely manage OAuth tokens and refresh tokens.
- THE system SHALL not store user passwords locally.

### 3.2 Role-Based Access Control

- THE system SHALL enforce access permissions strictly based on roles: guest, member, admin.
- THE system SHALL prevent privilege escalation by validating permissions on every data access or modification.

### 3.3 Token Management and Session Security

- THE system SHALL use JWT tokens with expiration times aligned to security best practices.
- THE system SHALL invalidate sessions upon logout or token expiration.
- THE system SHALL protect against replay attacks and token forgery.

### 3.4 Data Encryption and Secure Storage

- THE system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- THE system SHALL use secure storage services for photos.

### 3.5 Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

- THE system SHALL implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse.
- THE system SHALL log and alert on suspicious activity patterns.

## 4. Data Privacy Measures

### 4.1 User Consent and Privacy Settings

- THE system SHALL allow users to configure privacy settings per travel record.
- THE system SHALL obtain explicit consent before collecting personal data.

### 4.2 Public vs Private Record Handling

- THE system SHALL respect the visibility setting of each record.
- THE system SHALL ensure private records are not accessible by other users.

### 4.3 Data Retention and Deletion Policies

- THE system SHALL provide users ability to delete records permanently.
- THE system SHALL comply with data retention regulations relevant to the jurisdiction.

### 4.4 Compliance with Relevant Data Protection Laws

- THE system SHALL comply with applicable laws such as GDPR or CCPA where relevant.

## 5. Audit and Logging Requirements

### 5.1 User Activity Logging

- THE system SHALL log critical user actions including login, logout, record creation, editing, deletion, and sharing changes.

### 5.2 Error and Exception Logging

- THE system SHALL log all error events with sufficient context for diagnostics.

### 5.3 Access and Change Audit Trails

- THE system SHALL maintain audit trails for changes to travel records, reviews, photos, and privacy settings.

### 5.4 Log Retention and Security

- THE system SHALL store logs securely with restricted access.
- THE system SHALL define retention periods for logs based on legal and operational requirements.

This document provides business rules, validation requirements, error handling scenarios, security standards, and auditing needs for backend developers building the TravelRecord system. All technical implementations such as data storage, encryption methods, API design, and infrastructure choices are delegated to the implementation team, ensuring they have full autonomy in technical decisions while fulfilling these business mandates.
