The Pay Band System must deliver an intuitive, responsive, and reliable experience for HR operators and employee viewers alike. While functional requirements define what the system does, non-functional requirements define how well it does it — under real-world conditions. This document specifies measurable, testable standards for performance, reliability, and accessibility that directly impact user satisfaction and system trustworthiness.

## Performance Expectations

THE Pay Band System SHALL process Excel uploads and render the initial Pay Band visualization within 5 seconds when the file contains up to 100 rows of compensation data. This threshold ensures HR operators do not experience perceptible delays during routine data onboarding, maintaining productivity and workflow continuity.

WHEN an HR operator modifies a Pay Band Min, Mid, or Max value using an interactive slider, THE system SHALL update the visualization and associated budget metrics within 300 milliseconds. This ensures a seamless, real-time feedback loop that supports rapid iterative analysis without lag or disorientation.

WHEN a budget simulation is triggered (e.g., +5% headcount, +10% average salary), THE system SHALL recalculate and display the new budget estimate and distribution impact within 500 milliseconds. This rapid response preserves the cognitive flow of strategic compensation planning and enables confident scenario exploration.

## Data Load Time

WHEN an HR operator uploads an .xlsx file with fewer than 100 rows, THE system SHALL complete validation, parsing, and internal state update within 5 seconds. This requirement ensures data ingestion remains efficient even on moderate network conditions and does not introduce bottlenecks during daily HR operations.

IF the uploaded .xlsx file exceeds 100 rows, THE system SHALL display a warning message informing the user that processing time may increase beyond 5 seconds, but SHALL still process the file to completion. The system SHALL NOT reject or truncate data based on file size alone. This ensures flexibility for larger teams while managing user expectations.

## UI Responsiveness

WHILE an HR operator is dragging a slider to adjust Pay Band Min/Mid/Max values, THE system SHALL throttle updates to no less than 10 frames per second (equivalent to one update every 100 milliseconds). This guarantees fluid, natural interaction even during rapid adjustments, preventing a "jittery" or unresponsive appearance.

WHEN a simulation parameter changes (headcount, average salary), THE system SHALL highlight the changed value and display the new budget result with a visual accent (e.g., color shift or animation) to reinforce causality and improve user comprehension.

## Concurrency Support

THE Pay Band System SHALL support a minimum of 10 concurrent HR operators performing simultaneous actions, including data upload, slider manipulation, and simulation execution. Each user session SHALL be fully isolated — modifications made by one HR operator SHALL NOT affect the data, visualization, or simulation state visible to another user. This ensures secure, independent use in organizational settings with multiple HR teams.

## Data Integrity

IF an uploaded .xlsx file contains invalid or malformed data (e.g., non-numeric salary, missing required column, improper date format), THE system SHALL reject the upload and display a clear, actionable error message listing each specific issue. The system SHALL NOT alter, corrupt, or overwrite existing compensation data already loaded and visualized.

WHILE simulation parameters are being adjusted or a new upload is in progress, THE system SHALL preserve the last valid state of the Pay Band visualization and budget calculation. This allows the user to recover gracefully from failed actions without losing prior work.

IF the system encounters an internal error (e.g., timeout, memory exhaustion) during processing, THE system SHALL revert to the last known safe state and display a generic notification: "An unexpected error occurred. Your last valid configuration has been restored." This prevents state corruption and maintains user trust.

## Browser Compatibility

THE Pay Band System SHALL fully support the latest two versions of the following browsers on desktop platforms:
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Apple Safari

The system SHALL NOT degrade functionality or layout in any of the supported browsers. All visualizations, sliders, and data displays SHALL render correctly and remain fully interactive.

## Accessibility

THE Pay Band System SHALL be fully navigable using keyboard-only input, allowing HR operators to tab through all interactive controls (upload button, sliders, simulation inputs) and activate them using the Enter or Space keys.

WHEN the Pay Band visualization renders, THE system SHALL generate equivalent textual ARIA labels for each job level band, specifying the Min, Mid, Max values and number of employees in each group. This enables screen readers to accurately convey the visualization content to users with visual impairments.

WHENEVER an error message is displayed, THE system SHALL ensure it is programmatically announced by screen readers using an appropriate ARIA live region. This ensures all users, regardless of ability, are aware of system feedback and can respond appropriately.
