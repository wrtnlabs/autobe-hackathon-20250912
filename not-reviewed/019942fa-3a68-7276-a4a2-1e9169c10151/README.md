## 1. User Message

> hello how are you. what can you do for me?

## 2. Assistant Message

> Hello! I'm here to help you design and build the backend server for your application. I can assist you in gathering your requirements, planning features, creating database schemas, designing APIs, generating test code, and implementing the backend logic.
> 
> To get started, could you please tell me what kind of system or application you want to build? For example, what is its main purpose, and what tasks or functions would you like it to have? Don't worry if you are not sure about technical detailsâ€”I will guide you step-by-step.

## 3. User Message

> Okay. I would like to build a service called "Specialty Coffee Log".
> 
> The main purpose of this service is to allow users to easily find information about specialty coffee cafes and to personally record and manage their experiences with the coffee they've had.
> 
> The main functions are as follows:
> 
> For Users:
> 
> They can sign up and log in.
> 
> They can view the list of all registered cafes and search for them by name.
> 
> They can create, update, and delete logs (bean name, a 1-5 star rating, tasting notes) for coffee they've had at a specific cafe.
> 
> They can view a collection of all their own coffee logs.
> 
> For Admins:
> 
> Admins can register, update, and delete new cafe information in the system.

## 4. Assistant Message

> Thank you for sharing the main purpose and core functions of the "Specialty Coffee Log" service. To make sure I fully understand your vision and gather all necessary requirements for backend development, I have a few questions:
> 
> 1. Regarding user accounts:
> - What kind of user information do you want to collect at sign-up? (e.g., email, username, password, profile details)
> - Would you like to support social login (Google, Facebook, etc.) or only traditional email/password login?
> - Should users be able to update their profile information?
> 
> 2. For cafe information:
> - What details do you want to store for each cafe? (e.g., name, address, contact info, opening hours, menu, photos?)
> - Should users be able to add new cafes or suggest edits, or is that only for admins?
> 
> 3. Regarding coffee logs by users:
> - Do users attach any other info with their logs besides bean name, rating, and tasting notes? For example, purchase date, brewing method, or photos?
> - Would you like to support sharing logs publicly or with selected friends, or are logs strictly private?
> 
> 4. For admin functions:
> - How is an admin different from a normal user in terms of authentication or permissions?
> - Should admins have their own login portal or role after normal login?
> 
> With these points clarified, we can detail out the entities, relationships, and operations for your backend server. Please let me know your thoughts or any other features you'd like to include.

## 5. User Message

> 1. regarding user accounts
> - i'd like to use an email 
> - no it just a inclues with milestone not mvp
> - yes.
> 
> 2. For cafe information
> - the each cafe has name, address, contact info, opening hours, menu, photo
> - users be able to add new cafes and suggest edits
> 
> 3. regarding coffee logs by users
> - Users can create, update, and delete logs for coffee they've had at a specific cafe.
> - Each log must contain the following information: bean name (text), a star rating (an integer from 1 to 5), tasting notes (text), and brewing method (text). Photo uploads are not required.
> - There must be a "My Page" where users can view a collection of all the logs they have created.
> -Logs are private. They should only be visible to the user who created them and cannot be shared with others.
> 
> 4. For admin functions:
> umm... i think we should get rid of about admin function in our mvp plan.

## 6. Assistant Message

> Thank you for the detailed answers. Here's a summary of the MVP scope for the "Specialty Coffee Log" service backend:
> 
> - Users can sign up and log in with email/password.
> - Users can update their profile information.
> - Users can view a list of all cafes and search by name.
> - Each cafe has name, address, contact info, opening hours, menu, and photo.
> - Users can add new cafes and suggest edits to existing ones.
> - Users can create, update, and delete their own coffee logs that include bean name, star rating (1-5), tasting notes, and brewing method.
> - Logs are private to the user; no sharing.
> - Users have a "My Page" to view all their logs in one place.
> - No admin role or functions in the MVP.
> 
> Before we proceed, do you want me to take this summary as the full specification and start generating the requirements specification document? Or is there anything else you'd like to specify or add?

## 7. User Message

> yes. this summary is correct. please generaing the requirements spec document

## 8. Analyze

### Roles

Name | Kind | Description
-----|------|--------------
guest | guest | Unauthenticated users who can browse public information such as cafe lists but cannot create logs or manage personal data. 
member | member | Authenticated users who can sign up, log in, manage their profile, create and manage their own coffee logs, and add or suggest edits to cafes. 

### Documents

## 9. User Message

> okay. i check your document. great specification, now we're move on the next step.

## 10. Assistant Message

> The requirements specification for the "Specialty Coffee Log" MVP has been completed and approved.
> 
> The next step is to generate the database schema and ERD documentation using the Prisma Agent.
> 
> I will proceed with generating the Prisma schema based on the analyzed requirements now.

## 11. Prisma

- document: [`docs/ERD.md`](./docs/ERD.md)
- namespaces: 3
- tables: 7
- success: true

## 12. User Message

> The current design specifies storing the ip_address and user_agent information for every unauthenticated visitor (guests) directly in the database. While this can be a powerful feature for tracking,
>  As the service grows, the guests table could become extremely large very quickly, which may impact database performance.
> If the primary goal for this data is general visitor analytics, using a dedicated log analysis tool or service might be more efficient and scalable than storing every entry in the main transactional database.
> It would be beneficial to re-confirm the specific business requirements for tracking every guest in this manner to ensure this approach is the most suitable one.

## 13. Assistant Message

> It seems like you are concerned about the storage of ip_address and user_agent information for unauthenticated visitors (guests) in the database.
> 
> Currently, this is not part of the MVP specification we finalized for the Specialty Coffee Log service, so there's no implemented design for guest tracking in the main database.
> 
> If you plan to track guest visits or collect visitor analytics, it's indeed a good idea to carefully consider the scale and purpose. For large-scale visitor analytics, specialized tools or services (like Google Analytics, Matomo, or server log analysis) are often more efficient and scalable than storing every visitor record in the main transactional database.
> 
> Would you like to discuss incorporating visitor tracking or analytics as a separate non-MVP feature? Or should we focus solely on the MVP backend service as currently specified?

## 14. User Message

> not we focus solely on the MVP backend service

## 15. Assistant Message

> We have completed the requirements specification and database schema for the Specialty Coffee Log MVP, and we have agreed to focus solely on the MVP backend service at this stage.
> 
> The next step is to design and generate the API interfaces for the backend service. This includes creating OpenAPI schemas and TypeScript/NestJS code for the APIs that support the user functions such as user authentication, cafe management, and coffee log management.
> 
> Shall I proceed with generating the API interface definitions now?

## 16. User Message

> yep go ahead

## 17. Interface

- schemas: 28
