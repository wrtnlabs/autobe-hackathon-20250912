   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of specialty coffee cafes. This
   * operation enables users, including guests and members, to search cafes by
   * name with case-insensitive partial matches and retrieve paginated results
   * ordered alphabetically.
   *
   * The operation interacts with the specialty_coffee_log_cafes table which
   * contains the core cafe data, including name, address, contact info,
   * opening hours, menu description, and photo URL. Soft deletion is
   * supported and deleted records are excluded from search results.
   *
   * Security considerations: This endpoint is public and requires no
   * authentication, allowing any user to browse and search cafes. Pagination
   * parameters help ensure efficient data retrieval and responsiveness.
   *
   * Related operations: cafe detail retrievals use GET /cafes/{cafeId}.
   * Creation and update require authenticated member roles.
   *
   * Expected behavior includes validation of search terms, pagination limits,
   * and ordering. Errors are handled by appropriate status codes for invalid
   * requests.
