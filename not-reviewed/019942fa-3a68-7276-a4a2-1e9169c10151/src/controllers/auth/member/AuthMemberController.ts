   * Register a new member account and issue JWT tokens based on

   * The join operation for members enables new users to register with the
   * system by supplying a valid email and password. The system verifies the
   * uniqueness of the email in the specialty_coffee_log_members table and
   * securely stores the password hash. Upon successful registration, the
   * operation issues authorized JWT tokens encapsulated in IAuthorized
   * response. This endpoint is essential for member onboarding and serves as
   * the entry point into the service.
   *
   * The operation interacts directly with the specialty_coffee_log_members
   * table, enforcing unique email keys and storing creation and update
   * timestamps. No user session is necessary for this, making it a public
   * endpoint.
   *
   * Users must provide a valid email format, and the password hashing logic
   * is performed server-side, not exposed in the API. Validation errors or
   * conflicts (such as email already registered) return appropriate HTTP
   * error codes.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring that password hashes comply with
   * industry standards and that tokens are securely generated and signed.
   *
   * This operation complements login and refresh token operations to provide
   * a full authentication lifecycle for members.

   * token and refresh token encapsulated in IAuthorized response.

   * Refresh JWT tokens for member using valid refresh token.
   *
   * The refresh operation enables members to renew their JWT access tokens by

   * token's validity, issuance date, and revocation status before issuing a
   * new set of tokens encapsulated in IAuthorized response.

   * re-authentication.
