# FlexOffice Backend Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

FlexOffice is a back-office management platform designed to unify organizational data management, empower non-developers with customizable UI building, enforce granular access control, enable collaboration, and provide actionable analytics and extensibility capabilities. This document details comprehensive backend business requirements, focusing first on the UI/Page Builder as the development priority.

## 2. Business Model

### 2.1 Why the Service Exists
Many organizations face challenges due to fragmented data sources and inflexible back-office tools that require technical expertise. FlexOffice exists to provide a unified platform for data integration and no-code UI customization, improving operational efficiency and collaboration in back-office functions.

### 2.2 Revenue Strategy
FlexOffice aims to generate revenue via subscription plans targeting medium and large enterprises. Additional income streams include a plugin marketplace offering premium widgets and developer services.

### 2.3 Growth Plan
User acquisition will prioritize enterprise onboarding through targeted marketing, partnerships, and continuous feature enhancements focusing on reliability and usability.

### 2.4 Success Metrics
- Number of active users and session duration
- Volume and frequency of data source connections
- UI/Page Builder usage and published dashboards
- Collaboration session counts and version rollbacks
- Customer retention and satisfaction
- Monitoring and alert resolution times

## 3. User Roles and Authentication

### 3.1 User Role Definitions
- **Admin:** Full system control including user and role management, system configurations, monitoring, audit log access.
- **Editor:** Create, edit, and manage pages, data entries, dashboards; comment and collaborate.
- **Viewer:** Read-only access to dashboards and reports.

### 3.2 Authentication Flow Requirements
- WHEN a user submits login credentials, THE system SHALL validate these credentials securely and establish a session within 2 seconds.
- THE system SHALL support OAuth2 and API Key authentication for external data sources.
- THE system SHALL enable users to log out, ending sessions securely.

### 3.3 Token Management and Session Handling
- THE system SHALL use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with access tokens expiring after 30 minutes and refresh tokens with 14-day expiry.
- JWT payload SHALL include user ID, role, and permissions.
- THE system SHALL support secure token storage and refresh mechanisms.

### 3.4 Permission Matrix
| Action                        | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
|------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|
| User management              | ✅    | ❌     | ❌     |
| System configuration        | ✅    | ❌     | ❌     |
| Create/Edit pages & widgets  | ✅    | ✅     | ❌     |
| View dashboards              | ✅    | ✅     | ✅     |
| Audit log access            | ✅    | ❌     | ❌     |

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 UI/Page Builder
- WHEN a user with Editor or Admin role drags and places widgets, THE system SHALL register the changes and update the layout.
- THE system SHALL provide widgets including tables, charts (bar, line, pie), filters, buttons, and forms.
- WHEN users define conditional logic, THE system SHALL store and execute these in real-time.
- THE system SHALL provide real-time previews reflecting changes immediately.
- THE system SHALL support predefined themes and custom CSS application.
- THE system SHALL persist page versions with rollback capabilities.
- THE system SHALL ensure compatibility with latest Chrome, Safari, and Edge, supporting PC and tablet responsive designs.

### 4.2 Access Control
- THE system SHALL implement RBAC with fixed roles initially (Admin, Editor, Viewer).
- THE system SHALL enforce permissions at table, column, and row granularity.
- THE system SHALL maintain audit logs recording all access and modifications.
- SSOs such as Google Workspace and Okta SHALL be supported.
- Audit logs SHALL be stored for at least 1 year.

### 4.3 Data Source Integration
- THE system SHALL support connections to MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
- THE system SHALL allow upload and syncing of Google Sheets and Excel files.
- Users SHALL be able to configure custom refresh intervals (minimum 1 minute, maximum 24 hours).
- THE system SHALL alert users on connection failures and implement retry logic.

### 4.4 Collaboration Features
- THE system SHALL permit concurrent editing with a configurable maximum of editors per page, default 5.
- THE system SHALL provide version control with change tracking and rollback.
- Comments and annotations SHALL be supported on page components.
- THE system SHALL implement conflict resolution prioritizing deterministic or manual approaches.
- Users SHALL receive change notifications in real-time.

### 4.5 Analytics and Dashboards
- Support bar, line, pie charts and KPI widgets.
- Multi-dimensional filtering and conditional queries.
- Export filtered data as CSV or Excel.

### 4.6 Administration and Monitoring
- Provide a monitoring console showing data source status and system health.
- Notification center for real-time alerts on failures/security events.
- Usage and activity reporting for team and user monitoring.

### 4.7 Extensibility
- Widget marketplace for pre-built widget installation.
- Support for custom JS/Python scripts.
- API SDK for developer module integrations.

## 5. Business Rules and Validation

### 5.1 Role-Based Permissions
- Users can only perform actions permitted by their assigned role.
- Editors cannot access administrative or audit data.
- Viewers have strictly read-only access.

### 5.2 Data Validation
- Data source credentials must be validated before syncing.
- Data integrity shall be checked on each sync; corrupted data batches must be rejected.

### 5.3 Collaboration Limits
- Maximum concurrent editors per page configurable; default limit enforced.
- Attempts to exceed editor limit SHALL be rejected with user notification.

### 5.4 Data Refresh Rules
- Refresh intervals configurable by users, min 1 minute, max 24 hours.
- Failed syncs SHALL trigger retries with exponential backoff and escalation if unresolved.

## 6. Error Handling and Recovery
- IF data source connection fails, THEN notify users within 5 seconds, log error, and start retry cycle.
- IF unauthorized action attempted, THEN deny access and log event.
- IF conflict detected during concurrent editing, THEN apply conflict resolution and notify users.
- IF token expires or is invalid, THEN force user logout with clear message.

## 7. Performance Requirements
- UI/Page Builder preview updates SHALL occur within 1 second of user interaction.
- Data sync SHALL complete within the configured interval with latency under 30 seconds.
- Access control checks SHALL be completed within 100 milliseconds per request.
- System SHALL support up to 1000 concurrent active users with graceful degradation beyond.

## 8. Future Considerations
- Support additional database types beyond MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- Introduce customizable user roles and dynamic permission management.
- Expand collaboration support to unlimited editors with advanced conflict handling.
- Enrich analytics widget options and export capabilities.
- Grow the plugin marketplace ecosystem with third-party developer contributions.
