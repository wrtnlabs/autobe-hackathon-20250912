# FlexOffice Backend Requirements Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive requirements analysis for the backend development of FlexOffice, a platform designed to unify and simplify back-office operations for organizations by integrating data sources, customizable UI building, secure access control, collaborative workflows, analytics, and extensibility.

## 2. Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
Organizations often struggle with fragmented internal data sources and lack user-friendly tools for back-office customization and collaboration. FlexOffice fills this gap by offering a unified platform that integrates various data sources into a single interface, enabling real-time updates, custom UI creation without coding, granular access control, and teamwork facilitation. FlexOffice addresses inefficiencies in data handling and tool management common in back-office operations.

### Revenue Strategy
The service is intended to generate revenue through a subscription model targeting medium to large enterprises requiring robust back-office solutions. Additional revenue streams may include premium plugin marketplace offerings and customized support packages.

### Growth Plan
User acquisition will focus on enterprise clients through targeted marketing and integration partnerships. Retention will be driven by continuous feature enhancements, high system reliability, and excellent support.

### Success Metrics
- Monthly active users (MAU)
- Data sources connected per organization
- UI/Page builder usage frequency
- Number of collaborative sessions
- Customer retention rate
- Incident response and resolution times

## 3. User Roles and Authentication

### Defined Roles
- **Admin**: Full system control including user management, configuration, audit reviews, and monitoring tools.
- **Editor**: Standard authenticated user with capabilities to create, edit, and manage back-office data, pages, and dashboards within scope.
- **Viewer**: Read-only user with permission to view dashboards and reports.

### Authentication Flow Requirements
- Supports secure login using OAuth2 and API keys.
- JWT tokens for session management with access and refresh tokens.
- Sessions to expire after configurable inactivity periods.
- Role information embedded in JWT payload.

### Permission Matrix
| Action                         | Admin | Editor | Viewer |
|--------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|
| Manage users                  | ✅    | ❌     | ❌     |
| Configure system settings     | ✅    | ❌     | ❌     |
| Create/Edit UI Pages          | ✅    | ✅     | ❌     |
| View Dashboards               | ✅    | ✅     | ✅     |
| Access Audit Logs             | ✅    | ❌     | ❌     |

### Future Support
Plan to support custom roles with customizable permissions.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 UI/Page Builder
- WHEN a user drags and drops widgets (tables, charts, filters, buttons, forms), THE system SHALL store and reflect these changes instantly in the user interface.
- WHEN users define conditional logic (e.g., button click triggering API calls), THE system SHALL store and execute these rules in real time.
- THE system SHALL provide real-time preview capabilities showing immediate effects of all changes.
- THE system SHALL support predefined themes and allow users to customize CSS.
- WHERE changes are made, THE system SHALL broadcast updates to connected collaborators within 1 second latency.
- THE system SHALL support browser compatibility with latest Chrome, Safari, and Edge.
- THE system SHALL ensure responsive design support for PC and tablet.

### 4.2 Access Control
- THE system SHALL implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with Admin, Editor, Viewer roles.
- THE system SHALL enforce granular permissions controlling access at table, column, and row levels.
- WHEN assigned a role, THE system SHALL apply corresponding permissions immediately.
- THE system SHALL record all user activities in audit logs searchable by authorized users.
- THE system SHALL support Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with Google Workspace and Okta.
- THE system SHALL retain audit logs for a minimum of one year.

### 4.3 Data Source Integration
- THE system SHALL support connections to MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
- THE system SHALL allow users to upload and synchronize Google Sheets and Excel files.
- WHEN a user configures data refresh intervals, THE system SHALL schedule and execute automatic synchronization according to those intervals.
- THE system SHALL notify users with alerts on connection failures and implement retry logic until recovery or manual intervention.

### 4.4 Collaboration Features
- THE system SHALL allow concurrent editing of pages with a configurable limit on the number of simultaneous editors per page.
- THE system SHALL maintain version control tracking all changes per page with rollback capability.
- THE system SHALL support comments and annotations on specific page components.
- THE system SHALL implement conflict resolution logic favoring edit prioritization rules to handle simultaneous edits.
- THE system SHALL generate change notifications to all relevant team members.

### 4.5 Analytics & Dashboards
- THE system SHALL support creation of bar, line, pie charts, and KPI widgets.
- THE system SHALL provide multi-dimensional filtering and conditional queries on data.
- WHEN users export data, THE system SHALL support CSV and Excel formats.

### 4.6 Administration & Monitoring
- THE system SHALL offer a monitoring console displaying status of data sources and system health metrics.
- THE system SHALL implement a notification center delivering real-time alerts on failures and security incidents.
- THE system SHALL provide usage reports tracking team and user activity.

### 4.7 Extensibility
- THE system SHALL support a widget marketplace for installing pre-built widgets.
- THE system SHALL allow custom scripts in JavaScript and Python to implement tailored business logic.
- THE system SHALL expose an API SDK enabling developers to build and integrate custom modules.

## 5. Business Rules and Validation
- User roles strictly define permissions; no user shall operate beyond assigned role rights.
- Only supported data sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Google Sheets, Excel) may be connected.
- Data sync schedules must allow user-defined intervals with minimum granularity of 1 minute.
- Maximum concurrent editors per page configurable; defaults to 5 editors.
- Audit logs must be immutable and stored securely for at least 12 months.
- Real-time preview updates shall not exceed 1-second latency.

## 6. Error Handling and Recovery
- IF data source connection fails, THEN the system SHALL alert users, log the error, and retry sync every 5 minutes until resolved.
- IF user attempts an unauthorized action, THEN the system SHALL deny the action and return an appropriate permission error.
- IF real-time collaboration encounters conflicts, THEN conflict resolution logic SHALL apply and notify users.
- IF scheduled data sync fails repeatedly beyond retry limits, THEN administrators SHALL be notified for manual intervention.

## 7. Performance Requirements
- THE system SHALL respond to UI/Page Builder changes and preview updates within 1 second.
- THE system SHALL synchronize data sources within the configured intervals with actual refresh latency under 30 seconds.
- THE system SHALL support up to 100 simultaneous active users per organization with graceful degradation.

## 8. Success Criteria and Metrics
- Full implementation of UI/Page Builder with real-time preview prioritized and confirmed.
- Secure and functional RBAC with fixed roles deployed.
- Data source integration operational for MySQL and PostgreSQL with configurable sync schedules.
- Collaboration features supporting limited concurrent editors functioning with conflict resolution.
- Positive feedback on system responsiveness and error handling.

## 9. Future Considerations and Expansion
- Extend data source support beyond initial MySQL/PostgreSQL.
- Implement customizable user roles and permissions.
- Enhance collaboration support to unlimited editors and more granular conflict resolution.
- Incorporate additional analytic widget types and export formats.
- Expand plugin marketplace with third-party developer ecosystem.
