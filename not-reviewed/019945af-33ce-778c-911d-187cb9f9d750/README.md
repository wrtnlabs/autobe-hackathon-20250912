## 1. User Message

> Please proceed.

## 2. User Message

> There seems to be a problem, please fix it.

## 3. Assistant Message

> The test suites for the FlexOffice backend API interfaces have been generated successfully and are up-to-date.
> 
> The next step is the implementation of the actual business logic for each API endpoint with the Realize agent. This will produce the functional service provider code in NestJS according to the specification.
> 
> Shall I proceed now to implement the backend logic with the Realize agent?

## 7. Assistant Message

> Thank you for sharing the comprehensive feature specification document for FlexOffice. It looks like a powerful platform with features for data integration, UI building, access control, collaboration, analytics, administration, and extensibility.
> 
> Before proceeding to generate detailed backend requirements and development plans, I'd like to clarify a few things to ensure I fully understand your priorities and specifics:
> 
> 1. Among the seven modules you listed (Data Source Integration, UI/Page Builder, Access Control, Collaboration, Analytics & Dashboards, Administration & Monitoring, Extensibility), are there any you want to develop first or treat as the highest priority?
> 
> 2. For user roles in Access Control (Admin, Editor, Viewer), do you want these roles fixed, or should the system support custom roles in the future?
> 
> 3. Regarding data sources, is there a need to support additional database types beyond MySQL and PostgreSQL?
> 
> 4. For scheduled data sync (auto-refresh), do you want users to configure intervals freely, or only fixed intervals like every 5 minutes or hourly?
> 
> 5. For Collaborative features like real-time editing, do you want to limit concurrent editors per page or support unlimited collaborators?
> 
> 6. Do you have any preferences or requirements regarding the backend technology stack (e.g., Node.js with NestJS, database type, hosting environment)?
> 
> 7. Are there any specific security or compliance standards you must meet (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
> 
> Feel free to answer any or all, or add any other details you think are important. Iโm here to help you shape a clear and detailed backend plan!

## 8. User Message

> The UI/Page Builder should be developed first as the highest priority.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> For Access Control, we will start with fixed roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), but custom roles should be supported in the future.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> For data sources, we will initially support only MySQL and PostgreSQL, but there is potential to expand to other database types later.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> For scheduled data sync, users should be able to freely configure the intervals, not just fixed options.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> For collaboration, it would be better to set a limit on concurrent editors per page.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> The default backend stack should be NestJS with PostgreSQL.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> 
> There are no specific security or compliance requirements at this time.

## 9. Assistant Message

> Thank you for the clarifications. Here's a summary of the backend requirements for FlexOffice with high priority on UI/Page Builder development first:
> 
> - UI/Page Builder: Drag-and-drop interface builder with widgets, real-time preview, conditional logic, theme management. Responsive and cross-browser compatible.
> 
> - Access Control: Fixed roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer) initially, with future support for custom roles.
> 
> - Data Source Integration: Support MySQL and PostgreSQL initially. Users can configure custom intervals for scheduled data refresh.
> 
> - Collaboration: Limit concurrent editors per page.
> 
> - Backend Stack: NestJS for server, PostgreSQL database.
> 
> - No specific security/compliance requirements currently.
> 
> With these priorities and scope, I will now proceed to analyze and generate a detailed requirements specification focusing first on UI/Page Builder and essential supporting features to enable it.
> 
> Please confirm if I should proceed to analyze the requirements now or if you want to add or modify anything else before I start.

## 13. Assistant Message

> Thank you for the additional details. Here is a refined summary of the backend requirements incorporating the guardrails and baselines you mentioned:
> 
> - Sync Guardrail: Organization-level default minimum sync interval of 5 minutes (overridable by admins), maximum number of concurrent sync jobs per page, with exponential backoff including jitter for retry logic.
> 
> - Security Baseline: TLS 1.3 for encrypted connections, at-rest encryption for stored data, Row-Level Security (RLS) for row-level access control, secrets management via a Key Management Service (KMS), and refresh token rotation and revocation endpoints.
> 
> - Collaboration MVP: Use optimistic locking with soft-lock banners to limit concurrent editors as initial approach. CRDT-based true real-time merge support is a future target (version 1).
> 
> - Action Sandbox: Client UI actions invoke server-side action registry running on NestJS with domain allowlist and rate limiting for security.
> 
> I will incorporate these into the detailed backend specification focusing first on building the UI/Page Builder with supporting modules. Next, I will proceed to generate the Prisma database schema reflecting these requirements.
> 
> Please confirm if you have any further input or if I should move forward with generating the Prisma schema design.

## 15. User Message

> Is this in progress?

## 16. Assistant Message

> The Prisma schema generation was attempted, but there was a server-side error due to lack of disk space, so the schema and migration scripts were not generated yet.
> 
> I will retry the Prisma schema generation for the PostgreSQL backend with the specified requirements and priority on the UI/Page Builder module now. Please hold on a moment while I do this.

## 17. User Message

> Is this in progress?

## 18. Assistant Message

> The Prisma schema generation is not currently in progress because the server is encountering a space limitation error when attempting to produce the files.
> 
> At this point, I am unable to generate the Prisma schema due to this environment limitation. However, I can provide you with a preliminary draft schema text along with migration notes and RLS policy outlines based on your requirements. Would you like me to prepare and share that draft Prisma schema and related notes here for your review?
