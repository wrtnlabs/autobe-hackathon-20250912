   * Notifications are stored in the community_ai_notifications table with
   * detailed information such as notification type, title, message content,
   * recipient user ID, creation date, and read status.
   *
   * The search supports parameters for filtering by recipient user,

   * parameters allow slicing large notification sets for efficient UI
   * display. Sorting rules facilitate ordering notifications by created date
   * or other supported fields.
   *
   * Security considerations ensure that only authorized users can access
   * their own notifications. This operation requires authenticated user roles
   * to protect personal notification data and maintain confidentiality.
   *
   * Response includes paginated notification summaries, providing essential
   * details for list views such as title, type, read status, and timestamps.
   * UI clients may link individual notification details via separate
   * operations.

   * This operation corresponds to the community_ai_notifications table
   * defined in the Prisma DB schema under the Notifications namespace.
