   *
   * This operation fetches data from the 'community_ai_content_flags' table,

   * defined in the Prisma schema, including related content references and
   * audit timestamps. If the flag record does not exist, an appropriate error
   * should be returned by the backend.

   * Related operations may include creating new flags, updating flag status,
