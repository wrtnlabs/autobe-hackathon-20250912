   * provider, API endpoint path, time ranges, response times, and status
   * codes.
   *
   * The data originates from the community_ai_api_usage_logs table in the
   * Prisma schema, which stores detailed request and response metadata for
   * API calls to external AI and notification services. This enables auditing
   * API performance and reliability.
   *
   * Users accessing this endpoint must be authorized appropriately. The
   * operation returns paginated results including structured data matching
   * the community_ai_api_usage_logs entity.
   *
   * Filters and pagination parameters are supplied in the request body.
   *
   * This operation serves as a key tool for monitoring and troubleshooting
   * third-party integration performance and usage patterns within the
   * platform.
