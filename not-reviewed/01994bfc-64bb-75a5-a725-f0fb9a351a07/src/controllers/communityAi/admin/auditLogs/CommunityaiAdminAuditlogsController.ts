   * Create a new audit log entry.
   *
   * Creates a new audit log record representing an action performed by a
   * user, admin, moderator, or system component. The operation requires
   * identification of the actor (optional member, admin, or moderator ids),
   * an action type string describing the performed event, and optional
   * detailed description, including IP and user-agent context.
   *
   * Security considerations ensure only authorized services or administrators
   * can create audit logs to maintain integrity. The audit log stores
   * immutable historical data for compliance, forensic, and monitoring
   * purposes.
   *
   * This operation is directly linked to the community_ai_audit_logs table in
   * the Prisma schema, ensuring all mandatory fields are properly handled.
   * Timestamping and relations to users allow traceability and auditability.
   *
   * Validation ensures that provided references (ids) exist and that action
   * types conform to known log types. Errors may result from invalid
   * references or insufficient authorization.
   *
   * Related API operations include update and delete, mainly for
   * administrative reasons although audit logs generally should not be
   * deleted.
   *
   * This endpoint returns the created audit log object for confirmation.
