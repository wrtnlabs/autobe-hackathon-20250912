   * Create a new permission for access control.
   *
   * Create a new permission entity defining an access right in the Community
   * AI platform. This API expects a unique permission_name and optional
   * descriptive information about the permission. It returns the created
   * permission record including timestamps. This operation is restricted to
   * authorized roles such as administrators since permission definitions
   * affect system-wide access control.
   *
   * Security: Only users with the 'admin' role should use this endpoint as it
   * influences access rights.
   *
   * This operation interfaces directly with the community_ai_permissions
   * table as defined in the Prisma schema. It strictly requires the
   * permission_name to be unique. Validation errors should be returned if
   * uniqueness is violated or required fields are missing.
   *
   * Related Operations: update permission, delete permission endpoints.
   *
   * Behavior: On success, the new permission is stored and returned. On
   * failure, appropriate HTTP error codes should be used with explanatory
   * messages.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body New permission creation data
