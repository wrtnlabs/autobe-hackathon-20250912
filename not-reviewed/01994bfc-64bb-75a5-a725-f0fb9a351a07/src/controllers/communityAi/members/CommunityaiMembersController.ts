   * Create a new community member account.
   *
   * Creates a new community member account in the system with necessary
   * authentication credentials and user profile data. The operation requires
   * a unique email address to prevent duplication and a password hash for
   * secure authentication. The member's display name is stored for display
   * purposes. Upon successful creation, timestamps record when the member was
   * created and last updated.
   *
   * Security considerations include ensuring email uniqueness and password
   * hashing on the client or server side before creation. The operation does
   * not expose the password hash but accepts it as input. No direct roles are
   * required for public registration.
   *
   * This operation is fundamental for onboarding new users who will then
   * interact with posts, comments, and AI-assisted features. It does not
   * require existing authentication and is publicly accessible.
   *
   * Errors occur if the email is already used or if validation rules are
   * violated. The system handles these internally and returns appropriate
   * error messages.
   *
   * No response body contains sensitive data such as password hashes; only
   * identifiers and display names are returned.
