   * The API ensures that the moderator role email uniqueness is enforced and

   * Moderators receive JWT tokens immediately after joining.
   *
   * This operation is part of the moderator authentication workflow,
   * complementing login and token refresh operations.
   *
   * Improper registration attempts (duplicate email, invalid formats) will be
   * rejected early with appropriate error responses.
