## 1. User Message

> Make Community website that can use AI features like "AI Commenting", "AI factcheck" etc

## 2. Assistant Message

> To build a community website with AI features such as "AI Commenting" and "AI Fact-check," let's start by gathering more details to understand your vision and requirements clearly.
> 
> 1. Could you please describe the main purpose of the community website? (e.g., general discussion, interest-based groups, Q&A, etc.)
> 2. Who are the users of the website? Are there different roles like admin, moderators, regular users?
> 3. For "AI Commenting," what kind of AI assistance do you expect? (e.g., auto-suggest comments, comment moderation, sentiment analysis)
> 4. For "AI Fact-check," should it automatically verify statements in posts and comments? How should it present fact-check results to users?
> 5. What other core features do you want in the community website? (e.g., user profiles, post creation, likes, notifications)
> 6. Do you have any requirements on what technology or platform to use? Or should it be a web app accessible via browsers?
> 7. Are there any particular design or user experience preferences?
> 
> Answering these will help me create a clear specification for development. Feel free to add any more ideas or features you want!
