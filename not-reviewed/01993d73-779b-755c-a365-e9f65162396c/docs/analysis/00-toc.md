# Study Planner Backend Functional and Business Requirements

## 1. Introduction
The study planner backend enables authenticated student users to plan, manage, and track their learning activities efficiently using a structured approach encompassing three study phases: preview, main learning, and review. This document defines the business requirements to guide backend developers in building a robust system supporting all necessary workflows, validations, notifications, and analytics.

## 2. Business Model
### Why This Service Exists
Students lack structured support to organize their study sessions by phase and track progress effectively. Existing solutions do not address the need for detailed phase-based study management, personalized reminders, and analytics for improvement.

### Core Value Proposition
Provide a backend system offering precise management of learning phases with flexible task management, content support, reminders, and analytic insights which help students study more efficiently.

## 3. User Roles and Authentication
### 3.1 User Role: Student
- THE system SHALL support a single role: authenticated student.
- Students CAN create, update, delete their own study tasks.
- Students CAN attach study contents (images, PDFs) and memos.
- Students CAN set alarms and receive notifications.
- Students CAN view progress and analytics data.

### 3.2 Authentication Requirements
- WHEN a user registers, THE system SHALL validate email uniqueness and store credentials securely.
- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL validate credentials and initiate a session with JWT tokens.
- THE system SHALL support email verification.
- THE system SHALL allow password reset via secure flows.
- THE system SHALL allow users to find their ID.
- THE system SHALL maintain session security, including logout and token expiration.

## 4. Study Activity Management
- THE system SHALL maintain three distinct, mandatory study phases per task: preview, main learning, and review.
- WHEN creating or updating a study task, THE system SHALL require association with a valid phase.
- THE system SHALL allow users to categorize tasks under predefined subjects and categories with detailed English categories: grammar, vocabulary, speaking, others.

## 5. Task Lifecycle Operations
- WHEN a student creates a task, THE system SHALL require a title, phase, category, optional description, attachments, memo, and optional alarm.
- THE system SHALL allow updating or deleting tasks and associated data.
- WHEN a student marks a phase completion, THE system SHALL record the timestamp and update progress.

## 6. Content and Memo Management
- THE system SHALL allow attachment of images (JPEG, PNG) and PDF files.
- THE system SHALL validate file types and size limits (maximum 10 MB per file).
- THE system SHALL store memos as text linked to study tasks.

## 7. Notification and Alarm System
- THE system SHALL allow alarms linked to specific study tasks.
- THE system SHALL support general reminders not tied to any task.
- THE system SHALL send Progressive Web App notifications at scheduled alarm times reliably.

## 8. Progress Tracking and Analytics
- THE system SHALL track completion status and timestamps per study phase and per task.
- THE system SHALL aggregate progress data to identify insufficient learning areas.
- THE system SHALL generate charts breaking down English categories for targeted improvement.

## 9. Business Rules and Validation
- THE system SHALL enforce category and phase validity on task creation or update.
- THE system SHALL reject unsupported file types and oversized attachments.
- THE system SHALL prevent unauthorized access or modification to other usersâ€™ data.
- THE system SHALL require authentication for all study task operations.

## 10. Error Handling
- IF authentication fails, THEN THE system SHALL respond with clear error messages and status 401 Unauthorized.
- IF invalid input is received, THEN THE system SHALL respond with status 400 Bad Request and detailed validation errors.
- IF a resource is not found or unauthorized, THEN THE system SHALL respond with 403 or 404 accordingly.
- IF notification delivery fails, THEN THE system SHALL retry up to three times and log failure.

## 11. Performance Requirements
- THE system SHALL respond to all user operations within 2 seconds under typical loads.
- THE system SHALL deliver notifications within 1 minute of the scheduled alarm.
