   * specific study phase (preview, main learning, review), and a subject
   * category (e.g., English grammar). Authorized users can modify attributes
   * including title and description.
   *
   * Security considerations ensure only the owner of the task (identified by
   * student_id) may successfully update the resource. Invalid or incomplete
   * data will result in a validation error.

   * defined in the Prisma schema, which stores the core study task entities
   * including relationships to students, study phases, and subject
   * categories.
   *
   * Validation rules enforce title presence and correct foreign key
   * association with existing phases and categories. Upon success, the
   * updated task record is returned.

   * to the UUID of the target study task to update.
