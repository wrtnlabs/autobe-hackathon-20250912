   * This operation provides user registration for the role freelancerUser,
   * whose users are individual freelancers able to create and send contracts
   * without approval. It consumes email and password. The email field
   * corresponds to easy_sign_freelancerusers.email which is unique. Password
   * hashes are stored in easy_sign_user_credentials linked by user id. Upon
   * successful registration, JWT tokens including accessToken and
   * refreshToken will be issued, represented by response type
   * IEasySignFreelancerUser.IAuthorized. This endpoint is open to new user
   * registrations, supporting token issuance and subsequent authenticated
   * access.
   *
   * Security considerations include proper password hashing before storage,
   * email uniqueness verification, and secure JWT token generation. This
   * operation forms the basis for all authenticated interactions for
   * freelancer users.
   *
   * Related operations include login and refresh token issuance, supporting
   * session management lifecycle.
   *
   * The path /auth/freelancerUser/join is explicitly designated for user
   * registration requests for this role.
   *
   * Soft deletion in easy_sign_freelancerusers supports user deactivation
   * without data loss.
