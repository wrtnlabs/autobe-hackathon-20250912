All requirements are written in natural language from the perspective of user actions and system behavior, with EARS keywords in English and all descriptive content in English. This document is the single source of truth for backend developers implementing core features. No technical implementation details (APIs, databases, frameworks) are specified—only what the system must do.\n\n---\n\n### Authentication & Session Management\n\n- THE system SHALL require all users to authenticate via email and password or OAuth 2.0 provider before accessing any feature.\n- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL issue a JWT access token with a 15-minute expiration and a refresh token with a 30-day expiration.\n- WHEN a user’s access token expires, THE system SHALL allow renewal using the refresh token if it is valid and not revoked.\n- WHILE a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL maintain an active session and protect all endpoints with token validation.\n- IF a user attempts to access a resource without a valid token, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code ‘AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID’.\n- IF a user tries to access a resource outside their role permissions, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 403 with error code ‘AUTH_PERMISSION_DENIED’.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to revoke all active sessions from their profile settings.\n- THE system SHALL audit and log all login attempts, including success, failure, and IP address.\n\n---\n\n### Resume Upload and Parsing\n\n- WHEN a candidate uploads a resume in PDF or DOCX format, THE system SHALL accept the file if it is under 5 MB and has a valid extension.\n- IF a candidate uploads a file with an invalid extension (e.g., .txt, .jpg), THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload and display “Only PDF and DOCX files are allowed.”\n- IF a candidate uploads a malformed or corrupted file, THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload and display “The file appears to be corrupted or unreadable.”\n- WHEN a valid resume is uploaded, THE system SHALL automatically extract the following fields: full name, email address, phone number, current job title, previous job titles, education history, and years of experience.\n- WHERE the system cannot extract a required field (e.g., email), THEN THE system SHALL mark the resume as “Incomplete” and notify the candidate to re-upload.\n- THE system SHALL store the original file securely and retain a parsed JSON representation of resume data.\n- THE system SHALL not store or process resumes from unauthenticated candidates.\n\n---\n\n### Tech Stack Extraction and Matching\n\n- WHEN the system processes a parsed resume, THE system SHALL scan all text fields for mentions of common technical skills such as programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), frameworks (e.g., React, Node.js), tools (e.g., Docker, AWS), and methodologies (e.g., Agile, CI/CD).\n- THE system SHALL maintain a dynamic, configurable master list of recognized tech stack terms.\n- WHEN a job posting is created with required tech skills, THE system SHALL match candidate resumes against these requirements and assign a skill match percentage based on overlap.\n- WHERE a resume contains the exact term “Node.js” and a job requires “Node.js”, THE system SHALL increment the match score by 10 points.\n- WHERE a resume contains a related term such as “JavaScript” and a job requires “Node.js”, THE system SHALL increment the match score by 5 points.\n- THE system SHALL highlight matched skills in the HR recruiter’s review interface and display unmatched skills separately.\n- THE system SHALL not infer skills from non-technical context (e.g., “worked on a project with React” does not imply hands-on experience).\n\n---\n\n### Job Posting Management\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter creates a new job posting, THE system SHALL require the following fields: title, department, location (city or remote), description, minimum experience level, and required tech skills.\n- THE system SHALL allow HR recruiters to edit job postings until the first application is submitted.\n- IF an HR recruiter attempts to edit a job posting after an application is received, THEN THE system SHALL prevent editing of the job title, department, location, and required tech skills.\n- WHEN a job posting is archived, THE system SHALL no longer accept new applications but retain existing ones for review.\n- THE system SHALL display active job postings to applicants in a searchable, filterable list.\n- WHERE a job posting has expired (date set by HR), THEN THE system SHALL automatically archive it and notify applicants that the role is no longer available.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a count of applicants per job posting and display it in the recruiter dashboard.\n\n---\n\n### Coding Test Automation\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter selects a candidate to move to the coding test stage, THE system SHALL generate a unique, time-limited coding challenge link for the candidate.\n- THE system SHALL provide a default assessment consisting of a single backend problem (e.g., “Build a REST API endpoint that returns paginated user data with filtering by role”).\n- WHEN a candidate accesses the coding test link, THE system SHALL start a 90-minute timer and lock the environment to prevent external resource access.\n- THE system SHALL automatically score the candidate’s submission based on test coverage, correctness, readability, and code structure.\n- WHEN a candidate submits their code, THE system SHALL send a notification to the technical reviewer with the score, submission link, and a summary of test results.\n- THE system SHALL store all code submissions securely and prevent access by anyone except assigned technical reviewers and system administrators.\n- IF a candidate fails to submit before the timer expires, THEN THE system SHALL auto-submit their current work and mark submission status as “Timed Out.”\n\n---\n\n### Interview Scheduling\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter selects a candidate to proceed to interview, THE system SHALL prompt for preferred dates and times from both the recruiter and candidate.\n- THE system SHALL synchronize the recruiter’s and candidate’s calendar availability by integrating with Google Calendar (see Integration Requirements).\n- WHILE both parties have overlapping availability, THE system SHALL recommend the earliest common slot and allow the recruiter to confirm it.\n- WHEN an interview slot is confirmed, THE system SHALL create a Google Calendar event with title, description, Zoom/Teams link (pre-configured), and automatic invitations to both parties.\n- IF a candidate cancels their interview, THEN THE system SHALL notify the recruiter and suggest alternative dates based on updated availability.\n- IF an HR recruiter cancels, THE system SHALL notify the candidate and offer a new window from their available times.\n- THE system SHALL not allow scheduling conflicts within the same user’s calendar.\n- THE system SHALL send a reminder email and SMS 24 hours and 1 hour before the scheduled interview.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Status Tracking\n\n- THE system SHALL define the following status pipeline for all candidates: “Application Received” → “Resume Evaluated” → “Coding Test Assigned” → “Coding Test Completed” → “Interview Scheduled” → “Interview Completed” → “Offer Extended” → “Hired” or “Rejected.”\n- WHEN a candidate’s status changes, THE system SHALL automatically log the change, the user who made it, and the timestamp.\n- IF a candidate’s resume fails parsing, THEN THE system SHALL set their status to “Resume Incomplete” and prevent progression.\n- IF a candidate’s coding test score is below the configured threshold (e.g., 60%), THEN THE system SHALL automatically set their status to “Rejected” and notify them.\n- IF a candidate completes all interviews and the hiring manager approves, THEN THE system SHALL allow HR recruiter to change status to “Offer Extended.”\n- WHERE a status change requires human approval (e.g., moving from “Interview Completed” to “Offer Extended”), THE system SHALL require a manual toggle with audit trail.\n- THE system SHALL display the candidate’s current status prominently to all authorized users.\n\n---\n\n### Notifications and Alerts\n\n- WHEN a candidate submits a resume, THE system SHALL trigger an email notification to the assigned HR recruiter with the subject: “New Application: [Candidate Name] for [Job Title].”\n- WHEN a coding test is completed, THE system SHALL send an email and SMS alert to the assigned technical reviewer.\n- WHEN an interview is scheduled, THE system SHALL send a calendar invitation, email, and SMS to both candidate and recruiter.\n- WHEN an interview is canceled or rescheduled, THE system SHALL notify both parties via email and SMS.\n- WHEN a candidate is rejected, THE system SHALL send an automated email with the subject: “Update on Your Application for [Job Title].”\n- WHEN a candidate is offered a position, THE system SHALL notify them via email with a personalized message and next steps.\n- WHEN a resume parse failure occurs, THE system SHALL notify the candidate via email with instructions to re-upload.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to toggle notification preferences for email and SMS in their profile settings.\n\n---\n\n### Data Export Functionality\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter clicks “Export Candidates”, THE system SHALL generate a CSV or Excel file containing all candidate data for selected job postings.\n- THE exported file SHALL include: candidate name, email, phone, applied job title, current status, skill match score, coding test score, interview status, and application date.\n- THE system SHALL exclude sensitive data such as full resume text or access tokens from exports.\n- THE system SHALL limit export generation to one file per 10 minutes to prevent server overload.\n- WHEN export generation completes, THE system SHALL notify the recruiter via email with a time-limited (24-hour) download link.\n- THE system SHALL log all export requests for audit purposes.\n\n---\n\n### External Calendar Integration\n\n- WHEN a recruiter schedules an interview, THE system SHALL communicate with the Google Calendar API to create, update, or cancel calendar events.\n- THE system SHALL authenticate with Google Calendar using OAuth 2.0 authorized by each HR recruiter’s Google account (individual token storage).\n- WHERE a calendar sync fails (e.g., network timeout or invalid token), THEN THE system SHALL log the failure, notify the recruiter via dashboard alert, and allow manual scheduling override.\n- THE system SHALL read the recruiter’s and candidate’s default calendar availability (work hours, time zones) and use it to recommend interview slots.\n- WHEN a candidate updates their availability in Google Calendar, THE system SHALL poll their calendar every 15 minutes for changes (based on permissions granted).\n- THE system SHALL never write to or modify any calendar event or detail outside the scope of ATS-managed interviews.\n\n---\n\n### AI Interview Question Recommendation\n\n- WHEN a technical reviewer opens a candidate’s profile, THE system SHALL analyze the resume and coding test submission to generate 3–5 tailored interview questions.\n- THE system SHALL use natural language processing to identify candidate’s skill depth, experience level, and project context from resume and code.\n- WHERE a candidate mentions “built a scalable microservices system using Node.js and Docker”, THE system SHALL recommend: “Explain how you handled service discovery and load balancing in this system.”\n- WHERE a candidate’s code has poor error handling, THE system SHALL recommend: “How would you handle a database connection failure in production?”\n- THE system SHALL not recommend questions that are purely theoretical or unrelated to the candidate’s stated experience.\n- THE system SHALL allow the technical reviewer to modify, remove, or add custom questions, and shall save those changes to the candidate’s file.\n- THE system SHALL use an internal, fine-tuned model trained on engineering interview best practices, and shall not send resume data to third-party AI APIs.\n\n---\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

This fragmentation leads to slow decision-making, inconsistent evaluations, missed candidates due to human error, and poor candidate experiences. The ATS (Applicant Tracking System) eliminates this inefficiency by automating workflow stages from resume ingestion to interview scheduling and status notifications, providing a centralized, auditable, and scalable platform for technical hiring.\n\nThe platform specifically addresses the unique needs of engineering teams that evaluate candidates on technical competencies, not just academic credentials. By integrating automated skill extraction, coding test automation, and AI-driven interview question generation, this system reduces bias in resume screening and ensures objective, repeatable evaluation criteria—something manually managed systems cannot reliably achieve.\n\nCompetitors such as Greenhouse and Lever provide general HR solutions but lack deep integration with technical hiring workflows such as automated code assessment scoring and recruiter-reviewer collaboration. This ATS fills that gap by being purpose-built for engineering hiring pipelines where technical aptitude is non-negotiable.\n\n### Revenue Strategy\n\nThis system is designed as an enterprise SaaS product for technology companies with 50+ engineers. Revenue is generated through:\n\n- **Monthly subscription tiers** based on number of active job postings and users\n- **Premium features**: AI interview question recommendation and advanced candidate ranking\n- **Custom integration fees** for enterprise-wide SSO or HRIS synchronization\n\nInitial adoption will target mid-size tech firms (100–500 employees) who experience high-volume engineering recruitment (50–200 applications per job posting) and need measurable reduction in time-to-hire.\n\n### Growth Plan\n\n1. **User Acquisition**: Target engineering managers and HR directors via LinkedIn campaigns, tech meetups, and word-of-mouth from early adopters.\n2. **Retention Strategy**: Ensure a 90%+ candidate completion rate for applications and automated notifications to improve system trust.\n3. **Expansion Path**: Seed feedback from early users to add multilingual resume parsing (Q3 2026), diversity analytics dashboards (Q4 2026), and API access for legacy HR systems (Q1 2027).\n\n### Success Metrics\n\nThe success of this ATS system will be measured by the following KPIs:\n\n- **Time-to-Hire Reduction**: From an industry average of 38 days to under 21 days\n- **Application Completion Rate**: 85% of applicants who start must complete resume upload and profile setup\n- **Interview-to-Offer Ratio**: 40% of candidates who reach interview stage must receive an offer (higher than industry average of 25%)\n- **HR Recruiter Utilization**: Reduce manual resume review time by 70% (from 15 minutes/resume to under 5 minutes)\n- **System Adoption Rate**: 95% of internal recruiters must use the ATS as their primary hiring tool within 90 days of rollout\n- **Candidate Satisfaction Score (CSAT)**: Minimum average score of 4.3/5 on post-application surveys\n\n## Core Value Proposition\n\nThe ATS provides a unified platform that connects every stakeholder in the engineering hiring process—recruiters, candidates, reviewers, and administrators—into a seamless workflow. Unlike email-based or spreadsheet-driven methods, this system ensures:\n\n- **Consistency**: Every candidate is evaluated against the same technical and behavioral criteria\n- **Speed**: Resume parsing, skill matching, and interview scheduling happen in minutes, not days\n- **Accountability**: Every action (status change, feedback note, interview decision) is logged and auditable\n- **Insight**: AI-driven suggestions surface overlooked talent and prevent unconscious bias in initial screening\n- **Integration**: Connection to Google Calendar eliminates double-booking and reduces no-shows by 30%\n\n## Target Users\n\nThis system serves four distinct roles, each with unique workflows:\n\n1. **HR Recruiter**\n   - Manages active job postings and application pipelines\n   - Reviews resumes extracted from PDF/Word uploads\n   - Initiates coding tests and schedules interviews\n   - Tracks candidate status transitions (e.g., \"Submitted\" → \"Coding Test Passed\" → \"Interview Scheduled\")\n   - Exports candidate lists to CSV/Excel for leadership reporting\n\n2. **Applicant**\n   - Registers and logs into a personal portal\n   - Uploads resumes in PDF or Word format\n   - Browses active job postings by department, location, and tech stack\n   - Views their own interview schedule and receives automated notifications\n   - Does not see other applicants’ data or internal feedback\n\n3. **Technical Reviewer**\n   - Receives alerts when a candidate submits a completed coding test\n   - Reviews automated scoring results and handwritten explanations\n   - Rates technical skills against a predefined matrix (e.g., Node.js, AWS, SQL)\n   - Has no access to scheduling, emails, or resume content unless explicitly linked to a candidate they are reviewing\n\n4. **System Admin**\n   - Configures system-wide settings (e.g., email templates, interview question banks)\n   - Manages user accounts and role assignments (including password resets and deactivations)\n   - Integrates and maintains external services such as Google Calendar and notification gateways\n   - Monitors system health, export job statuses, and audit logs\n   - Has full access to all data and can override most business rules\n\n## Market Position\n\nThis ATS occupies a niche in the technical recruitment market by being **engineering-first**. While general HR platforms prioritize compliance and HR process automation, this system prioritizes:\n\n- Automated evaluation of technical skill (not just keywords)\n- Bi-directional integration with coding assessment platforms\n- Collaborative feedback between recruiter and technical reviewer\n- Job postings that mirror actual engineering role requirements (e.g., \"Must have 3+ years of Terraform experience\")\n\nIt appeals to companies that treat engineering hiring as a core competency—not a HR task. Its strategic advantage is **accuracy**: by pairing AI-powered skill extraction with human reviewer validation, it reduces false positives and negatives in candidate selection.\n\n## Integration Requirements\n\nThis system must integrate with external services to function effectively:\n\n- **Google Calendar**: The system SHALL create, update, and delete calendar events for scheduled interviews based on recruiter and candidate availability. Events SHALL include candidate name, interview role (e.g., \"Technical Screening\"), and a join link. Calendar sync failures shall trigger an automated email notification to the recruiter.\n\n- **Email Messaging Gateway**: The system SHALL send automated emails via an external SMTP or third-party provider (e.g., SendGrid). Email content SHALL be templated based on status triggers, including:\n  - Resume received confirmation\n  - Coding test invitation\n  - Interview reminder (24 hours before)\n  - Offer letter and rejection notices\n\n- **Resume Parsing Engine**: The system SHALL support parsing of DOCX and PDF files to extract name, email, phone number, education history, work experience, and technical skills. This process SHALL occur automatically upon upload.\n\n## Non-Functional Expectations\n\n- **Response Time**: All user-facing interfaces SHALL load within 2 seconds under normal load (100 concurrent users)\n- **System Availability**: The system SHALL be available 99.9% of business hours (9 AM–6 PM KST, Monday–Friday)\n- **Data Export Performance**: CSV/Excel exports involving 500+ candidates SHALL complete within 5 minutes\n- **Notification Delay**: Email and SMS notifications SHALL be sent within 1 minute of triggering event\n- **Concurrency**: The system SHALL support up to 500 simultaneous uploads of resumes without degradation\n\n## Vision and Mission\n\n**Vision**: To become the most trusted technical hiring platform for engineering teams by eliminating subjective screening and accelerating the match between talent and opportunity.\n\n**Mission**: To automate administrative hiring tasks so that human experts can focus on evaluating technical fit and cultural alignment, not paperwork.\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

All requirements are written in natural language from the perspective of user actions and system behavior, with EARS keywords in English and all descriptive content in English. This document is the single source of truth for backend developers implementing core features. No technical implementation details (APIs, databases, frameworks) are specified—only what the system must do.\n\n---\n\n### Authentication & Session Management\n\n- THE system SHALL require all users to authenticate via email and password or OAuth 2.0 provider before accessing any feature.\n- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL issue a JWT access token with a 15-minute expiration and a refresh token with a 30-day expiration.\n- WHEN a user’s access token expires, THE system SHALL allow renewal using the refresh token if it is valid and not revoked.\n- WHILE a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL maintain an active session and protect all endpoints with token validation.\n- IF a user attempts to access a resource without a valid token, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code ‘AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID’.\n- IF a user tries to access a resource outside their role permissions, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 403 with error code ‘AUTH_PERMISSION_DENIED’.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to revoke all active sessions from their profile settings.\n- THE system SHALL audit and log all login attempts, including success, failure, and IP address.\n\n---\n\n### Resume Upload and Parsing\n\n- WHEN a candidate uploads a resume in PDF or DOCX format, THE system SHALL accept the file if it is under 5 MB and has a valid extension.\n- IF a candidate uploads a file with an invalid extension (e.g., .txt, .jpg), THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload and display “Only PDF and DOCX files are allowed.”\n- IF a candidate uploads a malformed or corrupted file, THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload and display “The file appears to be corrupted or unreadable.”\n- WHEN a valid resume is uploaded, THE system SHALL automatically extract the following fields: full name, email address, phone number, current job title, previous job titles, education history, and years of experience.\n- WHERE the system cannot extract a required field (e.g., email), THEN THE system SHALL mark the resume as “Incomplete” and notify the candidate to re-upload.\n- THE system SHALL store the original file securely and retain a parsed JSON representation of resume data.\n- THE system SHALL not store or process resumes from unauthenticated candidates.\n\n---\n\n### Tech Stack Extraction and Matching\n\n- WHEN the system processes a parsed resume, THE system SHALL scan all text fields for mentions of common technical skills such as programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), frameworks (e.g., React, Node.js), tools (e.g., Docker, AWS), and methodologies (e.g., Agile, CI/CD).\n- THE system SHALL maintain a dynamic, configurable master list of recognized tech stack terms.\n- WHEN a job posting is created with required tech skills, THE system SHALL match candidate resumes against these requirements and assign a skill match percentage based on overlap.\n- WHERE a resume contains the exact term “Node.js” and a job requires “Node.js”, THE system SHALL increment the match score by 10 points.\n- WHERE a resume contains a related term such as “JavaScript” and a job requires “Node.js”, THE system SHALL increment the match score by 5 points.\n- THE system SHALL highlight matched skills in the HR recruiter’s review interface and display unmatched skills separately.\n- THE system SHALL not infer skills from non-technical context (e.g., “worked on a project with React” does not imply hands-on experience).\n\n---\n\n### Job Posting Management\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter creates a new job posting, THE system SHALL require the following fields: title, department, location (city or remote), description, minimum experience level, and required tech skills.\n- THE system SHALL allow HR recruiters to edit job postings until the first application is submitted.\n- IF an HR recruiter attempts to edit a job posting after an application is received, THEN THE system SHALL prevent editing of the job title, department, location, and required tech skills.\n- WHEN a job posting is archived, THE system SHALL no longer accept new applications but retain existing ones for review.\n- THE system SHALL display active job postings to applicants in a searchable, filterable list.\n- WHERE a job posting has expired (date set by HR), THEN THE system SHALL automatically archive it and notify applicants that the role is no longer available.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a count of applicants per job posting and display it in the recruiter dashboard.\n\n---\n\n### Coding Test Automation\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter selects a candidate to move to the coding test stage, THE system SHALL generate a unique, time-limited coding challenge link for the candidate.\n- THE system SHALL provide a default assessment consisting of a single backend problem (e.g., “Build a REST API endpoint that returns paginated user data with filtering by role”).\n- WHEN a candidate accesses the coding test link, THE system SHALL start a 90-minute timer and lock the environment to prevent external resource access.\n- THE system SHALL automatically score the candidate’s submission based on test coverage, correctness, readability, and code structure.\n- WHEN a candidate submits their code, THE system SHALL send a notification to the technical reviewer with the score, submission link, and a summary of test results.\n- THE system SHALL store all code submissions securely and prevent access by anyone except assigned technical reviewers and system administrators.\n- IF a candidate fails to submit before the timer expires, THEN THE system SHALL auto-submit their current work and mark submission status as “Timed Out.”\n\n---\n\n### Interview Scheduling\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter selects a candidate to proceed to interview, THE system SHALL prompt for preferred dates and times from both the recruiter and candidate.\n- THE system SHALL synchronize the recruiter’s and candidate’s calendar availability by integrating with Google Calendar (see Integration Requirements).\n- WHILE both parties have overlapping availability, THE system SHALL recommend the earliest common slot and allow the recruiter to confirm it.\n- WHEN an interview slot is confirmed, THE system SHALL create a Google Calendar event with title, description, Zoom/Teams link (pre-configured), and automatic invitations to both parties.\n- IF a candidate cancels their interview, THEN THE system SHALL notify the recruiter and suggest alternative dates based on updated availability.\n- IF an HR recruiter cancels, THE system SHALL notify the candidate and offer a new window from their available times.\n- THE system SHALL not allow scheduling conflicts within the same user’s calendar.\n- THE system SHALL send a reminder email and SMS 24 hours and 1 hour before the scheduled interview.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Status Tracking\n\n- THE system SHALL define the following status pipeline for all candidates: “Application Received” → “Resume Evaluated” → “Coding Test Assigned” → “Coding Test Completed” → “Interview Scheduled” → “Interview Completed” → “Offer Extended” → “Hired” or “Rejected.”\n- WHEN a candidate’s status changes, THE system SHALL automatically log the change, the user who made it, and the timestamp.\n- IF a candidate’s resume fails parsing, THEN THE system SHALL set their status to “Resume Incomplete” and prevent progression.\n- IF a candidate’s coding test score is below the configured threshold (e.g., 60%), THEN THE system SHALL automatically set their status to “Rejected” and notify them.\n- IF a candidate completes all interviews and the hiring manager approves, THEN THE system SHALL allow HR recruiter to change status to “Offer Extended.”\n- WHERE a status change requires human approval (e.g., moving from “Interview Completed” to “Offer Extended”), THE system SHALL require a manual toggle with audit trail.\n- THE system SHALL display the candidate’s current status prominently to all authorized users.\n\n---\n\n### Notifications and Alerts\n\n- WHEN a candidate submits a resume, THE system SHALL trigger an email notification to the assigned HR recruiter with the subject: “New Application: [Candidate Name] for [Job Title].”\n- WHEN a coding test is completed, THE system SHALL send an email and SMS alert to the assigned technical reviewer.\n- WHEN an interview is scheduled, THE system SHALL send a calendar invitation, email, and SMS to both candidate and recruiter.\n- WHEN an interview is canceled or rescheduled, THE system SHALL notify both parties via email and SMS.\n- WHEN a candidate is rejected, THE system SHALL send an automated email with the subject: “Update on Your Application for [Job Title].”\n- WHEN a candidate is offered a position, THE system SHALL notify them via email with a personalized message and next steps.\n- WHEN a resume parse failure occurs, THE system SHALL notify the candidate via email with instructions to re-upload.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to toggle notification preferences for email and SMS in their profile settings.\n\n---\n\n### Data Export Functionality\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter clicks “Export Candidates”, THE system SHALL generate a CSV or Excel file containing all candidate data for selected job postings.\n- THE exported file SHALL include: candidate name, email, phone, applied job title, current status, skill match score, coding test score, interview status, and application date.\n- THE system SHALL exclude sensitive data such as full resume text or access tokens from exports.\n- THE system SHALL limit export generation to one file per 10 minutes to prevent server overload.\n- WHEN export generation completes, THE system SHALL notify the recruiter via email with a time-limited (24-hour) download link.\n- THE system SHALL log all export requests for audit purposes.\n\n---\n\n### External Calendar Integration\n\n- WHEN a recruiter schedules an interview, THE system SHALL communicate with the Google Calendar API to create, update, or cancel calendar events.\n- THE system SHALL authenticate with Google Calendar using OAuth 2.0 authorized by each HR recruiter’s Google account (individual token storage).\n- WHERE a calendar sync fails (e.g., network timeout or invalid token), THEN THE system SHALL log the failure, notify the recruiter via dashboard alert, and allow manual scheduling override.\n- THE system SHALL read the recruiter’s and candidate’s default calendar availability (work hours, time zones) and use it to recommend interview slots.\n- WHEN a candidate updates their availability in Google Calendar, THE system SHALL poll their calendar every 15 minutes for changes (based on permissions granted).\n- THE system SHALL never write to or modify any calendar event or detail outside the scope of ATS-managed interviews.\n\n---\n\n### AI Interview Question Recommendation\n\n- WHEN a technical reviewer opens a candidate’s profile, THE system SHALL analyze the resume and coding test submission to generate 3–5 tailored interview questions.\n- THE system SHALL use natural language processing to identify candidate’s skill depth, experience level, and project context from resume and code.\n- WHERE a candidate mentions “built a scalable microservices system using Node.js and Docker”, THE system SHALL recommend: “Explain how you handled service discovery and load balancing in this system.”\n- WHERE a candidate’s code has poor error handling, THE system SHALL recommend: “How would you handle a database connection failure in production?”\n- THE system SHALL not recommend questions that are purely theoretical or unrelated to the candidate’s stated experience.\n- THE system SHALL allow the technical reviewer to modify, remove, or add custom questions, and shall save those changes to the candidate’s file.\n- THE system SHALL use an internal, fine-tuned model trained on engineering interview best practices, and shall not send resume data to third-party AI APIs.\n\n---\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

This integration ensures that all interview times are automatically reflected in both the ATS and the users' personal or team Google Calendars, preventing double-booking and reducing administrative overhead.\n\n### Data Exchange Requirements\n- WHEN an HR recruiter schedules a new interview in the ATS, THE system SHALL create a corresponding calendar event in the interviewer's and candidate's Google Calendar.\n- WHEN an interview is modified in the ATS (date, time, location, or participants change), THE system SHALL update the corresponding calendar event in Google Calendar.\n- WHEN an interview is cancelled in the ATS, THE system SHALL delete or mark as cancelled the corresponding calendar event in Google Calendar.\n- THE system SHALL transmit the following structured event data to Google Calendar:\n  - title: \"[Job Title] Interview with [Applicant Name]\"\n  - description: \"Interview for [Job Title] position. Applicant: [Applicant Name] | Email: [Applicant Email] | Interviewers: [HR Name, Technical Reviewer Name] | ATS Link: [URL]\"\n  - start time: ISO 8601 format (e.g., \"2025-09-15T10:00:00+09:00\")\n  - end time: ISO 8601 format (e.g., \"2025-09-15T11:00:00+09:00\")\n  - location: \"Virtual via Zoom\" or \"Office B3-05, Seoul\"\n  - attendees: email addresses of both applicant and interviewers (HR and technical reviewer)\n  - visibility: \"private\" for all calendar events\n- IF the Google Calendar API returns an error during event creation, modification, or deletion, THEN THE system SHALL log the error with the original request ID and send a system notification to the HR recruiter with instructions to manually update the calendar.\n\n### Integration Account Requirements\n- THE system SHALL use a dedicated service account (OAuth 2.0 client credentials) with the following Google OAuth scopes:\n  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar\n  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events\n  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly\n- THE system SHALL store the OAuth refresh token securely in the system's encrypted secret vault and use it to automatically renew expired access tokens.\n- THE system SHALL ensure the service account has been granted domain-wide delegation (if used in a corporate G Suite environment) or has been explicitly shared calendar access by individual HR recruiters/candidates.\n- WHERE a candidate's email is not recognized as a valid Google account, THE system SHALL create the calendar event only for the recruiter and interviewers, and send the candidate a calendar invite via email as a fallback.\n\n## Email Messaging Integration\n\n### Business Purpose\nTo deliver automated, timely, and personalized communications to applicants and staff—reducing human error, increasing candidate engagement, and ensuring compliance with communication protocols during hiring.\n\n### Data Exchange Requirements\n- WHEN a candidate's status changes (e.g., from \"Document Submitted\" to \"Coding Test Scheduled\"), THE system SHALL trigger an email notification to the candidate using the template defined for that status transition.\n- WHEN an interview is scheduled, modified, or cancelled, THE system SHALL send a notification email to both the applicant and all assigned interviewers.\n- WHEN a candidate passes or fails the coding test, THE system SHALL send a formal email with feedback (if provided by technical reviewer) and next steps.\n- WHEN a candidate is accepted or rejected, THE system SHALL send a final email response within 1 hour of status update.\n- THE system SHALL use an email service provider (ESP) that supports:\n  - Transactional email APIs with high deliverability (98%+)\n  - Template management with variables (e.g., {{applicant_name}}, {{job_title}}, {{interview_link}})\n  - Bounce and complaint tracking\n  - DKIM/SPF/DMARC authentication\n  - Rate limiting of 100 messages per minute\n- IF an email fails to send due to invalid address, server error, or spam filter rejection, THEN THE system SHALL log the failure, attempt retry (up to 3 times over 24 hours), and escalate to the HR recruiter via in-app notification if all retries fail.\n- THE system SHALL store all sent email content, headers, timestamps, and delivery statuses for audit purposes.\n- WHERE an applicant has not verified their email address, THE system SHALL NOT send any communication until verification is complete.\n\n## External Resume Parsing Service\n\n### Business Purpose\nTo automatically extract structured data from unstructured resumes submitted in PDF or Word format, reducing manual data entry and improving accuracy and consistency in candidate profiles.\n\n### Data Exchange Requirements\n- WHEN a candidate uploads a resume file (.pdf, .doc, .docx), THE system SHALL send the file to the external resume parsing service with a request for structured extraction.\n- THE system SHALL submit the following data to the parser:\n  - file: the raw binary content of the uploaded document\n  - file_type: extension of the file (pdf, doc, docx)\n  - language: auto-detected or explicitly specified from the document\n  - employer_id: the internal organization ID associated with the job posting\n- THE system SHALL expect the following structured JSON response from the parser:\n  - full_name: string (required)\n  - email: email address (required)\n  - phone: string in international format (e.g., \"+821012345678\") (required)\n  - current_location: string (e.g., \"Seoul, South Korea\")\n  - education: array of objects with fields: institution, degree, field, start_date, end_date\n  - work_experience: array of objects with fields: company, title, start_date, end_date, description\n  - skills: array of strings (e.g., [\"Python\", \"Node.js\", \"AWS\"])\n  - certifications: array of strings (e.g., [\"AWS Certified Solutions Architect\"])\n- IF the parsing service returns an error (e.g., corrupted file, unsupported format, service unreachable), THEN THE system SHALL:\n  - retain the original file for manual review\n  - set candidate status to \"Resume Pending Manual Review\"\n  - notify the HR recruiter by in-app alert\n- IF the parser returns incomplete data, such as missing email or name, THEN THE system SHALL:\n  - retain the extracted information\n  - flag the candidate profile as \"Partial Data Extracted\"\n  - prompt the HR recruiter to manually confirm and complete missing fields\n- THE system SHALL rate-limit requests to the parsing service to no more than 6 requests per minute to avoid rate throttling.\n- WHERE multiple documents are uploaded by a single candidate, THE system SHALL process only the most recently uploaded file.\n\n## Authentication Provider (OAuth 2.0)\n\n### Business Purpose\nTo enable secure, standardized, and user-friendly authentication for all user roles while reducing password management overhead and supporting enterprise identity federation.\n\n### Data Exchange Requirements\n- THE system SHALL support login via SSO (Single Sign-On) using OAuth 2.0 with the following providers:\n  - Google (google.com)\n  - Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)\n- WHEN a user selects \"Sign In with Google\" or \"Sign In with Microsoft\", THE system SHALL redirect the browser to the respective provider's authorization endpoint with:\n  - client_id: registered in the provider's console\n  - redirect_uri: https://atsSystem.example.com/auth/callback\n  - scope: openid profile email\n  - response_type: code\n- AFTER authentication, THE provider SHALL redirect to the system with an authorization code.\n- THE system SHALL exchange the authorization code for an ID token and access token using a backend server-to-server POST request.\n- THE system SHALL validate the ID token signature, issuer, audience, and expiration.\n- THE system SHALL extract the following claims from the ID token:\n  - sub (user identifier)\n  - email\n  - name\n  - picture (optional)\n  - hd (for G Suite domains)\n- IF the user's domain is not on the approved list (e.g., \"example.com\"), THEN THE system SHALL deny access and display: \"Access denied. Please use an approved organization email.\"\n- WHERE a user logs in successfully for the first time, THE system SHALL automatically create a new account with role \"applicant\" by default, unless the email matches a known HR recruiter or system admin in the user directory.\n- THE system SHALL require re-authentication via OAuth every 30 days for all users.\n- IF the OAuth identity provider returns an error (e.g., token expired, invalid redirect), THEN THE system SHALL redirect user to login screen with error message: \"Authentication failed. Please try again.\"\n\n## Notification Gateway Provider\n\n### Business Purpose\nTo deliver time-critical SMS alerts to candidates and recruiters, ensuring no important updates (e.g., interview reminders or scheduling changes) are missed due to email overload or delayed access.\n\n### Data Exchange Requirements\n- WHEN a candidate's interview is scheduled within 24 hours, THE system SHALL send an SMS reminder to the candidate’s phone number obtained from the resume.\n- WHEN an interview is rescheduled or cancelled, THE system SHALL send an SMS notification to both the applicant and all assigned interviewers, unless the update occurs less than 60 minutes before the scheduled time—in which case, only an email is sent.\n- WHEN a candidate receives final status (accepted/rejected), THE system SHALL send an SMS notification if the candidate has explicitly opted in via profile settings.\n- THE system SHALL use a SMS gateway provider with:\n  - API access to send bulk and transactional messages\n  - Support for international dialing codes (including +82 for South Korea)\n  - Delivery receipts and error reporting\n  - Rate limit of 10 messages per second per API key\n  - Compliance with local messaging regulations (Korea’s Telecommunications Business Act)\n- THE system SHALL collect and store the candidate’s mobile number in format \"+821012345678\" (international format) during resume parsing.\n- WHERE a phone number is missing or invalid, THE system SHALL skip SMS delivery and fall back to email notification.\n- IF the SMS gateway returns an error (e.g., invalid recipient, credit exhausted), THEN THE system SHALL log the failure, attempt one retry after 5 minutes, and then escalate to an in-app alert for HR action if retry fails.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a local log of all sent SMS messages, including timestamp, recipient, content, delivery status, and provider response code.\n- WHERE a user has declared \"Do not contact via SMS\" in their profile settings, THE system SHALL suppress all SMS notifications for that user, even if other triggers activate."},{"filename":"06-business-rules.md","reason":"Captures critical business logic, validation constraints, and operational constraints that govern system behavior beyond basic functionality.","documentType":"requirement","outline":["Resume Validation Rules","Technical Skill Matching Logic","Interview Scheduling Constraints","Candidate Status Transition Rules","Notification Trigger Rules","Export Data Format Rules","AI Interview Question Generation Rules"],"audience":"backend developers","constraints":["All rules must be written as business constraints, not technical implementations","Must cover dynamic behavior such as automatic status transitions","Must describe edge conditions for AI recommendation engine"],"keyQuestions":["What validation must be applied to user inputs?","How do candidate statuses change automatically?","What business logic governs AI-generated interview questions?"],"detailLevel":"detailed specification","content":"## Resume Validation Rules\n\nWHEN an applicant uploads a resume file, THE system SHALL accept only PDF (.pdf) and Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx) file formats. \n\nIF the file extension is not one of [.pdf, .doc, .docx], THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload with error message: \"Unsupported file format.

These metrics are not technical performance indicators but are instead business-oriented measurements tied directly to hiring outcomes, user experience, and operational efficiency. Each metric includes a baseline (current state without ATS), a target (goal after implementation), and a method of measurement.\n\n### Introduction to Success Metrics\n\nThe primary objective of the ATS system is to replace manual, fragmented hiring processes (spreadsheet tracking, email coordination, paper resumes) with an integrated digital workflow that accelerates hiring, reduces administrative burden, and improves candidate experience. Success will be measured not by system uptime or code quality, but by how effectively the system enables hiring teams to fill roles faster, with better quality of hire, and with greater satisfaction from all stakeholders.\n\nAll metrics must be tracked monthly and reported to HR leadership and engineering leadership to drive iterative improvement. Data collection is enabled via system logs, user interactions, and automated surveys — no manual data entry shall be required.\n\n### Time-to-Hire Reduction\n\nThe time-to-hire is the number of calendar days between when a candidate first submits an application and when they accept an offer.\n\nWHEN a candidate applies to a job posting, THE system SHALL begin tracking the time-to-hire clock.\nWHEN a candidate accepts a job offer, THE system SHALL stop the time-to-hire clock.\nTHE system SHALL calculate and store this value automatically for every hire.\n\nThe baseline time-to-hire across the organization is currently 42 days. \nTHE system SHALL reduce the average time-to-hire to 28 days within six months of full deployment.\nWHEN the average time-to-hire drops below 25 days for three consecutive months, THE system SHALL be considered highly successful in accelerating hiring.\n\nThe system SHALL measure time-to-hire by calculating the difference between the application submission timestamp (when candidate status changes from \"Application Received\" to \"Resume Verified\") and the offer acceptance timestamp (when candidate status changes from \"Offer Extended\" to \"Hired\").\n\n### Application Completion Rate\n\nThe application completion rate measures the percentage of candidates who begin the application process and successfully submit a complete application.\n\nWHEN a candidate starts filling out an application, THE system SHALL record the start event.\nWHEN a candidate submits their resume and completes required fields, THE system SHALL record the completion event.\nTHE system SHALL calculate the application completion rate as: (Completed Applications / Started Applications) × 100.\n\nThe current application completion rate is 58% due to long forms and unclear instructions.\nTHE system SHALL increase the application completion rate to 80% or higher within six months.\nIF the completion rate falls below 70% for two consecutive months, THEN THE system SHALL trigger an alert to the system admin to review the application flow.\n\nThe system SHALL track completion rate by counting the number of candidates who reach the \"Resume Verified\" status divided by the number of candidates who reach the \"Application Started\" status.\n\n### Interview-to-Offer Ratio\n\nThe interview-to-offer ratio measures the efficiency of the selection process — how many interviews are required, on average, before an offer is extended.\n\nWHEN a candidate is scheduled for an interview, THE system SHALL increment the interview count for that candidate.\nWHEN an offer is extended to a candidate, THE system SHALL record the final interview count.\nTHE system SHALL calculate the average interview-to-offer ratio across all hires.\n\nThe current ratio is 3.8 interviews per offer due to misaligned screening.\nTHE system SHALL reduce the average interview-to-offer ratio to 2.2 or lower within six months.\nWHERE the technical reviewer provides feedback of \"strong fit\" on the first review, THE system SHALL log the candidate as a \"high-confidence match.\"\nWHEN more than 60% of hires are classified as high-confidence matches, THEN THE system SHALL be considered to have improved screening quality.\n\nThe system SHALL calculate this ratio by dividing the total number of interviews conducted by the total number of offers extended across all job postings over a given period.\n\n### HR Recruiter Utilization\n\nHR recruiter utilization measures the reduction in time spent on administrative tasks (resume screening, scheduling, email follow-ups) and the increase in time spent on strategic hiring activities (candidate conversations, stakeholder alignment).\n\nWHILE a recruiter is logged in, THE system SHALL log time spent on:\n- Manual resume review\n- Calendar scheduling\n- Email and message responses\n- System-driven actions (e.g., clicking \"schedule interview\" or \"approve candidate\")\n\nTHE system SHALL calculate the percentage of time spent on system-driven actions versus manual actions.\n\nThe current baseline is 72% manual administrative work and 28% strategic work.\nTHE system SHALL shift this ratio to 35% manual and 65% strategic within six months.\nIF the percentage of manual time drops below 30% for three consecutive months, THEN THE system SHALL be considered to have achieved significant productivity gains.\n\nThe system SHALL measure utilization by combining user interaction logs with time-to-action metrics. For example, when an HR recruiter clicks \"Schedule Interview\" and the system auto-fills the time based on calendar availability, this SHALL count as a system-driven action.\n\n### Candidate Satisfaction\n\nCandidate satisfaction is measured via an automated, post-process survey sent to every applicant, regardless of outcome.\n\nWHEN a candidate’s application status changes to \"Hired\" or \"Rejected,\" THE system SHALL automatically send an email with a 5-question survey.\n\nSurvey questions (1–5 scale):\n1. How easy was it to apply for this position?\n2. How clear was the communication during the process?\n3. How professional was the interaction with our team?\n4. How well did the process reflect the company’s culture?\n5. Would you recommend our hiring process to a friend?\n\nTHE system SHALL calculate the average score across all submissions.\nTHE system SHALL maintain a candidate satisfaction score of 4.2 or higher on average.\nIF the score falls below 3.8 for two months in a row, THEN THE system SHALL lock further job postings until the HR team investigates the feedback.\n\nThe system SHALL collect survey responses via embedded survey links in automated emails and SHALL calculate the average score using a weighted mean of all completed surveys.\n\n### System Adoption Rate\n\nSystem adoption rate measures the percentage of eligible users actively using the ATS system for hiring activities.\n\nWHEN a user logs in and performs any action (viewing candidates, scheduling interviews, reviewing resumes, exporting lists), THE system SHALL record an active session.\n\nThe eligible user population includes:\n- All HR recruiters\n- All technical reviewers\n- All system administrators\n\nThe baseline adoption rate is 40% (many still use email and spreadsheets).\nTHE system SHALL increase the active adoption rate to 95% or higher within three months of full deployment.\n\nWHEN a user has not logged in for 14 consecutive days, THE system SHALL send one reminder email.\nWHEN a user has been inactive for 28 days, THEN THE system SHALL flag the account to the system admin for re-engagement.\n\nThe system SHALL track adoption by counting unique weekly active users (WAU) who perform at least one of the defined actions and dividing by the total number of eligible user accounts.\n\n### Target Benchmarks and Baselines\n\n| Metric | Baseline (Current) | Target (6 Months) | Critical Threshold |\n|--------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Time-to-Hire | 42 days | ≤28 days | ≤25 days (for 3 months) |\n| Application Completion Rate | 58% | ≥80% | ≥70% |\n| Interview-to-Offer Ratio | 3.8 interviews | ≤2.2 interviews | ≤2.0 interviews |\n| HR Recruiter Manual Time | 72% | ≤35% | ≤30% |\n| Candidate Satisfaction | 3.6 (avg) | ≥4.2 | ≥3.8 |\n| System Adoption Rate | 40% | ≥95% | ≥90% |\n\n### Monitoring and Reporting\n\nAll metrics shall be updated daily and presented in a public dashboard available to:\n- HR leadership\n- Engineering leadership\n- The system admin\n\nEach metric shall be visualized as a trend line over time with alerts configured for:\n- 10% deviation below target for two weeks\n- 15% deviation below critical threshold\n\nThe report shall be generated automatically every Monday morning and emailed to department heads.\n\nWHEN a metric surpasses its target for three consecutive months, THE system SHALL recommend a new, higher target based on historical improvement rate.\n\nThe system SHALL log all metric calculations, including the data sources and timestamp of calculation, with audit trail access for compliance purposes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n    A[\"Time-to-Hire Reduction\"] --> D[\"Strategic Talent Pipeline\"]\n    B[\"Application Completion Rate\"] --> D\n    C[\"Interview-to-Offer Ratio\"] --> D\n    E[\"HR Recruiter Utilization\"] --> D\n    F[\"Candidate Satisfaction\"] --> D\n    G[\"System Adoption Rate\"] --> D\n    D[\"Strategic Talent Pipeline\"] --> H[\"Lower Cost-per-Hire\"]\n    D --> I[\"Higher Quality of Hire\"]\n    D --> J[\"Improved Employer Brand\"]\n    D --> K[\"Regulatory Compliance\"]\n```\n\n> *Developer Note: This document defines **business requirements only**.

All requirements are written in natural language from the perspective of user actions and system behavior, with EARS keywords in English and all descriptive content in English. This document is the single source of truth for backend developers implementing core features. No technical implementation details (APIs, databases, frameworks) are specified—only what the system must do.\n\n---\n\n### Authentication & Session Management\n\n- THE system SHALL require all users to authenticate via email and password or OAuth 2.0 provider before accessing any feature.\n- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL issue a JWT access token with a 15-minute expiration and a refresh token with a 30-day expiration.\n- WHEN a user’s access token expires, THE system SHALL allow renewal using the refresh token if it is valid and not revoked.\n- WHILE a user is authenticated, THE system SHALL maintain an active session and protect all endpoints with token validation.\n- IF a user attempts to access a resource without a valid token, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code ‘AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID’.\n- IF a user tries to access a resource outside their role permissions, THEN THE system SHALL return HTTP 403 with error code ‘AUTH_PERMISSION_DENIED’.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to revoke all active sessions from their profile settings.\n- THE system SHALL audit and log all login attempts, including success, failure, and IP address.\n\n---\n\n### Resume Upload and Parsing\n\n- WHEN a candidate uploads a resume in PDF or DOCX format, THE system SHALL accept the file if it is under 5 MB and has a valid extension.\n- IF a candidate uploads a file with an invalid extension (e.g., .txt, .jpg), THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload and display “Only PDF and DOCX files are allowed.”\n- IF a candidate uploads a malformed or corrupted file, THEN THE system SHALL reject the upload and display “The file appears to be corrupted or unreadable.”\n- WHEN a valid resume is uploaded, THE system SHALL automatically extract the following fields: full name, email address, phone number, current job title, previous job titles, education history, and years of experience.\n- WHERE the system cannot extract a required field (e.g., email), THEN THE system SHALL mark the resume as “Incomplete” and notify the candidate to re-upload.\n- THE system SHALL store the original file securely and retain a parsed JSON representation of resume data.\n- THE system SHALL not store or process resumes from unauthenticated candidates.\n\n---\n\n### Tech Stack Extraction and Matching\n\n- WHEN the system processes a parsed resume, THE system SHALL scan all text fields for mentions of common technical skills such as programming languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript), frameworks (e.g., React, Node.js), tools (e.g., Docker, AWS), and methodologies (e.g., Agile, CI/CD).\n- THE system SHALL maintain a dynamic, configurable master list of recognized tech stack terms.\n- WHEN a job posting is created with required tech skills, THE system SHALL match candidate resumes against these requirements and assign a skill match percentage based on overlap.\n- WHERE a resume contains the exact term “Node.js” and a job requires “Node.js”, THE system SHALL increment the match score by 10 points.\n- WHERE a resume contains a related term such as “JavaScript” and a job requires “Node.js”, THE system SHALL increment the match score by 5 points.\n- THE system SHALL highlight matched skills in the HR recruiter’s review interface and display unmatched skills separately.\n- THE system SHALL not infer skills from non-technical context (e.g., “worked on a project with React” does not imply hands-on experience).\n\n---\n\n### Job Posting Management\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter creates a new job posting, THE system SHALL require the following fields: title, department, location (city or remote), description, minimum experience level, and required tech skills.\n- THE system SHALL allow HR recruiters to edit job postings until the first application is submitted.\n- IF an HR recruiter attempts to edit a job posting after an application is received, THEN THE system SHALL prevent editing of the job title, department, location, and required tech skills.\n- WHEN a job posting is archived, THE system SHALL no longer accept new applications but retain existing ones for review.\n- THE system SHALL display active job postings to applicants in a searchable, filterable list.\n- WHERE a job posting has expired (date set by HR), THEN THE system SHALL automatically archive it and notify applicants that the role is no longer available.\n- THE system SHALL maintain a count of applicants per job posting and display it in the recruiter dashboard.\n\n---\n\n### Coding Test Automation\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter selects a candidate to move to the coding test stage, THE system SHALL generate a unique, time-limited coding challenge link for the candidate.\n- THE system SHALL provide a default assessment consisting of a single backend problem (e.g., “Build a REST API endpoint that returns paginated user data with filtering by role”).\n- WHEN a candidate accesses the coding test link, THE system SHALL start a 90-minute timer and lock the environment to prevent external resource access.\n- THE system SHALL automatically score the candidate’s submission based on test coverage, correctness, readability, and code structure.\n- WHEN a candidate submits their code, THE system SHALL send a notification to the technical reviewer with the score, submission link, and a summary of test results.\n- THE system SHALL store all code submissions securely and prevent access by anyone except assigned technical reviewers and system administrators.\n- IF a candidate fails to submit before the timer expires, THEN THE system SHALL auto-submit their current work and mark submission status as “Timed Out.”\n\n---\n\n### Interview Scheduling\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter selects a candidate to proceed to interview, THE system SHALL prompt for preferred dates and times from both the recruiter and candidate.\n- THE system SHALL synchronize the recruiter’s and candidate’s calendar availability by integrating with Google Calendar (see Integration Requirements).\n- WHILE both parties have overlapping availability, THE system SHALL recommend the earliest common slot and allow the recruiter to confirm it.\n- WHEN an interview slot is confirmed, THE system SHALL create a Google Calendar event with title, description, Zoom/Teams link (pre-configured), and automatic invitations to both parties.\n- IF a candidate cancels their interview, THEN THE system SHALL notify the recruiter and suggest alternative dates based on updated availability.\n- IF an HR recruiter cancels, THE system SHALL notify the candidate and offer a new window from their available times.\n- THE system SHALL not allow scheduling conflicts within the same user’s calendar.\n- THE system SHALL send a reminder email and SMS 24 hours and 1 hour before the scheduled interview.\n\n---\n\n### Candidate Status Tracking\n\n- THE system SHALL define the following status pipeline for all candidates: “Application Received” → “Resume Evaluated” → “Coding Test Assigned” → “Coding Test Completed” → “Interview Scheduled” → “Interview Completed” → “Offer Extended” → “Hired” or “Rejected.”\n- WHEN a candidate’s status changes, THE system SHALL automatically log the change, the user who made it, and the timestamp.\n- IF a candidate’s resume fails parsing, THEN THE system SHALL set their status to “Resume Incomplete” and prevent progression.\n- IF a candidate’s coding test score is below the configured threshold (e.g., 60%), THEN THE system SHALL automatically set their status to “Rejected” and notify them.\n- IF a candidate completes all interviews and the hiring manager approves, THEN THE system SHALL allow HR recruiter to change status to “Offer Extended.”\n- WHERE a status change requires human approval (e.g., moving from “Interview Completed” to “Offer Extended”), THE system SHALL require a manual toggle with audit trail.\n- THE system SHALL display the candidate’s current status prominently to all authorized users.\n\n---\n\n### Notifications and Alerts\n\n- WHEN a candidate submits a resume, THE system SHALL trigger an email notification to the assigned HR recruiter with the subject: “New Application: [Candidate Name] for [Job Title].”\n- WHEN a coding test is completed, THE system SHALL send an email and SMS alert to the assigned technical reviewer.\n- WHEN an interview is scheduled, THE system SHALL send a calendar invitation, email, and SMS to both candidate and recruiter.\n- WHEN an interview is canceled or rescheduled, THE system SHALL notify both parties via email and SMS.\n- WHEN a candidate is rejected, THE system SHALL send an automated email with the subject: “Update on Your Application for [Job Title].”\n- WHEN a candidate is offered a position, THE system SHALL notify them via email with a personalized message and next steps.\n- WHEN a resume parse failure occurs, THE system SHALL notify the candidate via email with instructions to re-upload.\n- THE system SHALL allow users to toggle notification preferences for email and SMS in their profile settings.\n\n---\n\n### Data Export Functionality\n\n- WHEN an HR recruiter clicks “Export Candidates”, THE system SHALL generate a CSV or Excel file containing all candidate data for selected job postings.\n- THE exported file SHALL include: candidate name, email, phone, applied job title, current status, skill match score, coding test score, interview status, and application date.\n- THE system SHALL exclude sensitive data such as full resume text or access tokens from exports.\n- THE system SHALL limit export generation to one file per 10 minutes to prevent server overload.\n- WHEN export generation completes, THE system SHALL notify the recruiter via email with a time-limited (24-hour) download link.\n- THE system SHALL log all export requests for audit purposes.\n\n---\n\n### External Calendar Integration\n\n- WHEN a recruiter schedules an interview, THE system SHALL communicate with the Google Calendar API to create, update, or cancel calendar events.\n- THE system SHALL authenticate with Google Calendar using OAuth 2.0 authorized by each HR recruiter’s Google account (individual token storage).\n- WHERE a calendar sync fails (e.g., network timeout or invalid token), THEN THE system SHALL log the failure, notify the recruiter via dashboard alert, and allow manual scheduling override.\n- THE system SHALL read the recruiter’s and candidate’s default calendar availability (work hours, time zones) and use it to recommend interview slots.\n- WHEN a candidate updates their availability in Google Calendar, THE system SHALL poll their calendar every 15 minutes for changes (based on permissions granted).\n- THE system SHALL never write to or modify any calendar event or detail outside the scope of ATS-managed interviews.\n\n---\n\n### AI Interview Question Recommendation\n\n- WHEN a technical reviewer opens a candidate’s profile, THE system SHALL analyze the resume and coding test submission to generate 3–5 tailored interview questions.\n- THE system SHALL use natural language processing to identify candidate’s skill depth, experience level, and project context from resume and code.\n- WHERE a candidate mentions “built a scalable microservices system using Node.js and Docker”, THE system SHALL recommend: “Explain how you handled service discovery and load balancing in this system.”\n- WHERE a candidate’s code has poor error handling, THE system SHALL recommend: “How would you handle a database connection failure in production?”\n- THE system SHALL not recommend questions that are purely theoretical or unrelated to the candidate’s stated experience.\n- THE system SHALL allow the technical reviewer to modify, remove, or add custom questions, and
