   * Create a new sponsorship event record.

   * Creates a new sponsorship event record capturing donation information

   * optional message, and linkage to the auction room and optionally the
   * donating member (team leader). The unique Chijijik sponsorship ID
   * prevents duplication. Animations triggered by the sponsorship can be
   * flagged.

   * Security considerations revolve around appropriate authorization for
   * creating sponsorship events, usually limited to system components or
   * admin roles interfacing with the Chijijik API or authenticated
   * processes.
   *
   * This operation interacts with the auction_platform_sponsorship_events
   * table, and successful creation results in immediate availability for
   * real-time auction bid updates and overlay broadcasts.
   *
   * Validation rules require the chijijik_sponsorship_id to be unique and
   * donation_amount to be a positive float.
   *
   * Related operations include updating or deleting sponsorship events.
   *
   * Error handling includes rejecting duplicates or invalid donation amounts.
