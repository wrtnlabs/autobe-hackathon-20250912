   * Delete a calendar event by ID (hard delete).
   *
   * This DELETE operation removes a calendar event identified by
   * calendarEventId from the auction platform's calendar_events data store.
   * The calendar event is linked to a specific auction room and contains
   * event details such as title, start and optional end times.
   *
   * Only authorized users with admin roles may perform this delete to prevent
   * unauthorized data removal. This operation permanently deletes the
   * calendar event from the database, ensuring the auction schedule is no
   * longer listed or active.
   *
   * This operation involves the auction_platform_calendar_events table in the
   * database and enforces referential integrity with the related auction
   * rooms through cascading deletes or similar strategies.
   *
   * Proper validation ensures calendarEventId corresponds to a valid record.
   * If not found, an error response should be returned.
   *
   * No request body is required since the only input is the calendarEventId
   * path parameter. No response body is returned; the successful deletion is
   * indicated by HTTP status code.
   *
   * This endpoint is typically invoked as part of schedule management
   * features by administrators managing auction rooms and events.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param calendarEventId Unique identifier of the calendar event to delete
