   * without login credentials, and their records contain email, optional
   * nickname, creation and update timestamps.
   *
   * This operation supports advanced filtering based on email and nickname,
   * with pagination and sorting to handle large datasets. Only users with
   * appropriate reading permissions should invoke this endpoint to ensure
   * guest data privacy and control.
   *
   * The underlying data is maintained in the auction_platform_guests table as
   * defined in the Prisma schema, leveraging its unique email constraint and
   * full-text indexing on nickname to optimize search functionality. The
   * returned data provides necessary fields for display and management while
   * keeping sensitive login information out, as guests do not have
   * credentials.
   *
   * Typical use cases include administrative consoles listing guest users,
   * monitoring system usage by non-registered visitors, and enabling
   * compliance reviews.
