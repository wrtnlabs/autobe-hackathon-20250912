# Functional Requirements for Real-Time Auction Platform with Chat and Sponsorship Integration

## 1. Business Model

The auction platform enables team leaders to bid on registered users in scheduled auction rooms linked with streamers. Real-time chat and sponsorship inputs via Chijijik API dynamically update auction bids and status, enhancing engagement and monetization.

Requirements focus on real-time responsiveness, user role management, auction integrity, and integration with streaming tools like OBS.

## 2. User Roles and Authentication

**Roles:**
- Guest: View-only access for unauthenticated users.
- Member (Team Leader): Authenticated users who can register auction users, place bids, and participate in chats.
- Admin: System administrators managing auctions, schedules, users, and API integrations.

**Authentication:**
- JWT-based authentication for API access.
- Role-based access control defined by user permissions.

## 3. Auction Management

- WHEN a streamer creates an auction room with a mandatory start time and optional end time, THE system SHALL register it on the calendar.
- THE system SHALL allow auction users to be registered with detailed profiles including gaming statistics.
- Team leaders SHALL receive an initial allocation of auction points used solely for bidding.
- WHEN a bid is submitted via chat or sponsorship input, THE system SHALL verify point sufficiency and update the auction state in real time.
- THE system SHALL determine winners based on highest bids at auction close and deduct points accordingly.

## 4. Real-Time Chat and Sponsorship Integration

- WHILE a streamer is live, THE system SHALL collect chat messages from the Chijijik API and store them using unique Chijijik IDs.
- THE system SHALL enforce rate limiting on chat message processing to maintain performance.
- Sponsorship events from the Chijijik API SHALL be captured with donor name, amount, and messages.
- THE system SHALL allow user-uploaded custom animations for sponsorship alerts.

## 5. Schedule and Calendar Management

- THE system SHALL provide CRUD operations for auction schedules with start time required and end time optional.
- Users may purchase icons using icon points to decorate calendar events.
- Schedule changes SHALL be tracked through audit logs.

## 6. Real-Time Updates and Notifications

- The system SHALL broadcast real-time updates of bids, chat messages, and sponsorship events.
- Real-time communication SHALL use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events.
- Updates SHALL propagate to all clients, including OBS browser sources, within 500 milliseconds.

## 7. OBS Integration

- THE system SHALL expose browser source URLs for real-time auction and chat overlays compatible with OBS.
- THE overlays SHALL display synchronized auction and chat data relevant to each streamerâ€™s auction room.

## 8. User Invitations and Access Control

- Auction room creators SHALL be able to invite team leaders.
- Invitations SHALL provide statuses: pending, accepted, or rejected.
- Access to auction participation SHALL be limited to authorized invitees.

## 9. Business Rules and Validation

- Bids SHALL not exceed the available auction points of a team leader.
- Chat and sponsorship bids SHALL be parsed and validated before applying.
- Auctions respect scheduled start and optional end times.
- Rate limiting SHALL prevent abuse of chat and sponsorship inputs.

## 10. Error Handling and Recovery

- THE system SHALL provide clear and descriptive error messages on bid or authentication failures.
- External API failures SHALL be logged and retried with appropriate backoff.
- THE system SHALL handle disconnections gracefully without data loss.

## 11. Performance Requirements

- THE system SHALL handle at least 50 concurrent auctions and 1000 simultaneous users.
- Real-time updates SHALL be delivered within 500ms latency.

## 12. External Integrations

- Integration with Chijijik API for real-time chat and sponsorship.
- OBS integration for overlay display.

## 14. Security and Compliance

- JWT based authentication with role-based authorization.
- Audit logs for all bidding and chat events.
- Compliance with data protection regulations.
