/**
 * End-to-end test verifying audit log detail retrieval for authentication
 * failure events by ID.
 *
 * 1. Register a system admin via /auth/systemAdmin/join and login as this
 *    admin (initial tokens are returned).
 * 2. Intentionally perform an HR recruiter login with bad credentials through
 *    /auth/hrRecruiter/login to trigger an authentication failure event.
 * 3. The server records an authentication failure. (We assume the API provides
 *    the failure log or its ID in the administrative interface; for this
 *    test, we will query the admin failure log detail endpoint using the
 *    most recent/accessible failure ID, which we expect was just created by
 *    the bad login attempt.)
 * 4. Retrieve the authentication failure log via
 *    /atsRecruitment/systemAdmin/authenticationFailures/{authenticationFailureId}
 *    using the admin token.
 * 5. Assert all details (attempted user/email, cause, timestamp, etc.) match
 *    the failed event we caused, and that business, PII, or compliance
 *    constraints are satisfied.
 * 6. Negative checks:
 *
 *    - Try to retrieve a non-existent/fake authentication failure ID, verify
 *         error handling.
 *    - Try as a non-admin (HR recruiter or unauthenticated), verify permission
 *         denial.
