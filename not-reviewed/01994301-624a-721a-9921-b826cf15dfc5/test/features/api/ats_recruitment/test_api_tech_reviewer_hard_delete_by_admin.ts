/**
 * Validate hard deletion of a technical reviewer by system administrator.
 *
 * This test confirms that a system admin can hard-delete a tech reviewer, and
 * that the deletion is irreversible via standard means. It additionally checks
 * that errors are raised for subsequent fetch/delete attempts, and that
 * deletion is properly audited.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register and authenticate a system admin via /auth/systemAdmin/join
 * 2. Create a tech reviewer account via /auth/techReviewer/join
 * 3. Delete the tech reviewer as system admin
 *    (/atsRecruitment/systemAdmin/techReviewers/{techReviewerId})
 * 4. Attempt to fetch the deleted reviewer (should error/not found - skipped, as
 *    fetch endpoint is unavailable in SDK)
 * 5. Attempt to delete the reviewer again (should error - not found or already
 *    deleted)
 * 6. (Audit: Not implemented here, as no endpoint exists, but business expectation
 *    is that deletion is recorded)
