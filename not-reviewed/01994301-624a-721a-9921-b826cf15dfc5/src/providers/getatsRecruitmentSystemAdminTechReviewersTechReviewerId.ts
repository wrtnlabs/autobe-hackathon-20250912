/**
 * Get full detail of a single technical reviewer from
 * ats_recruitment_techreviewers by ID.
 *
 * This operation retrieves the full detail of a specific technical reviewer
 * account using its unique identifier. It targets the
 * ats_recruitment_techreviewers table and returns all fields required for
 * profile and privilege auditing in the recruitment system.
 *
 * Designed for detailed review and verification, this endpoint enables system
 * administrators to fetch all information about a given tech reviewerâ€”including
 * identifiers, name, email, specialization, status, and audit timestamps. It
 * queries the ats_recruitment_techreviewers entity by unique reviewer ID, and
 * serves for administrative audit, support, or compliance purposes.
 *
 * Access is strictly controlled: only systemAdmin users may acquire full
 * account details of a technical reviewer, given the sensitive nature of the
 * personnel involved in technical recruitment assessments. Usage may include
 * security checks, privilege management, or remediation workflows.
 *
 * Associated error responses include not-found for missing reviewerId or
 * permission errors if invoked by unauthorized actors. The output is suitable
 * for detailed enterprise UI display or for audit logging functions.
 *
 * @param props - Properties for the operation
 * @param props.systemAdmin - Authenticated system admin user (authorization
 *   enforced)
 * @param props.techReviewerId - The unique identifier of the technical reviewer
 *   to retrieve
 * @returns IAtsRecruitmentTechReviewer with all profile and audit fields; never
 *   includes sensitive credential fields
 * @throws {Error} If reviewer is not found (404) or soft-deleted, or if called
 *   by non-admin
