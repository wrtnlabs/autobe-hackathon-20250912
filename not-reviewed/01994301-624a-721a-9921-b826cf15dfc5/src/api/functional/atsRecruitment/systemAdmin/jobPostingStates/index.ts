/**
 * Create a new job posting state (ats_recruitment_job_posting_states) in the
 * system.
 *
 * Allows a system administrator to define a new job posting workflow state,
 * such as introducing a new official lifecycle step (e.g., open, paused,
 * archived). The endpoint validates that a unique state_code is provided (not
 * present in soft-deleted or active states) and all essential fields—including
 * label, is_active, description, and sort_order—are present. Additional rules
 * for label format and allowed state_code patterns are enforced as per platform
 * requirements.
 *
 * Upon successful creation, the detailed entity record is returned to the
 * caller. If state code conflict, input validation, or insufficient privilege
 * occurs, clear errors are returned. Only users with the systemAdmin role can
 * invoke this endpoint due to the potential global platform impact of creating
 * new workflow states.
 *

 *   including workflow code, label, description, active status, and sort
 *   order.
