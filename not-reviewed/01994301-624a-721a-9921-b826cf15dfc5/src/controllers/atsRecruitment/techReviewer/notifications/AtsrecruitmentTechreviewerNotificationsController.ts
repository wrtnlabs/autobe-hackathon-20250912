  /**
   * Create a new notification event in the ATS notification system
   * (ats_recruitment_notifications table).
   *
   * This API allows authorized system actors to create a notification intent
   * for delivery to users. Each notification consists of business context
   * (type, related entity), recipients (by role and user id), reference to the
   * business table and entity (such as an application or interview), and
   * payload parameters for template rendering.
   *
   * This operation does not directly deliver or send the notification but
   * creates a business event that will then be processed by the notification
   * service and delivery system. Only users with roles that have privilege to
   * create notifications may invoke this operation; in general, hrRecruiter,
   * techReviewer, and systemAdmin may generate notifications relevant to
   * business workflow. Applicant-facing notifications should typically be
   * system-triggered, not user-triggered.
   *
   * Security and privacy are enforced by checking both the callers'
   * authentication/authorization context and the validity of reference ids. All
   * creation events are captured for audit and compliance. Certain types may
   * require business validation (e.g., disallowing HR to send notifications on
   * behalf of systemAdmin). Field and template references must be valid and
   * reference permissible entity types according to business rules.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Notification creation data: recipient, event type, reference
   *   business entity, and payload.

   * Search, filter, and paginate notification records in the ATS
   * (ats_recruitment_notifications).
   *
   * This endpoint enables advanced querying and paginated retrieval of
   * notification records, drawing from the ats_recruitment_notifications table.
   * Users can specify a variety of search and filter criteria, such as event
   * type (e.g., status updates, system alerts), delivery status (pending, sent,
   * failed), recipient roles (applicant, HR recruiter, tech reviewer,
   * systemAdmin), creation/update time ranges, and references to associated
   * business context (application, interview, export job, etc.).
   *
   * Authenticated users—admins, HR recruiters, and tech reviewers—use this
   * operation to manage, audit, or troubleshoot notification workflows.
   * Granular permission checks ensure users see only notifications relevant to
   * their role or those they are authorized to view. The API supports sorting,
   * field selection, and efficient pagination for large datasets, optimizing
   * admin and support workflows in large-scale recruitment operations.
   *
   * Error handling covers invalid filter requests, permissions issues, and
   * server failures. Related APIs include notification detail retrieval and raw
   * notification delivery logs, as part of comprehensive notification
   * management capabilities.

  /**
   * Update a notification event's metadata/status/payload by notificationId
   * (ats_recruitment_notifications).
   *
   * This API allows privileged actors (such as systemAdmin, techReviewer, or
   * hrRecruiter depending on notification type) to update an existing
   * notification event, changing status or payload if needed for workflow
   * continuity or correction. Notification records are immutable for certain
   * statuses (e.g., after delivery), and audit trails are mandatory for
   * compliance.
   *
   * Typical use cases include adjusting notification status (e.g., from pending
   * to cancelled), correcting related entity references, or updating template
   * payload before final delivery. Attempting to update notifications already
   * processed (delivered or failed) will result in an error. Only system-level
   * roles and privileged notification creators should use this endpoint.
   *
   * All changes are logged and subject to business/process validation. Proper
   * permission checks and entity existence validation are performed for every
   * update request. This endpoint does not directly manage delivery attempts or
   * channel-level logs; it only updates notification record metadata and
