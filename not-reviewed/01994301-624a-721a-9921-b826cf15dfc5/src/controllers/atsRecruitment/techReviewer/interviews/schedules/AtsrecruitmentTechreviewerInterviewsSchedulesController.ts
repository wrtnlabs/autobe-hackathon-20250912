   * Create a new interview schedule slot for a specific interview
   * (ats_recruitment_interview_schedules).
   *
   * This API operation creates a new schedule entry linked to a specific
   * interview in the ATS recruitment platform. The schedule slot includes
   * fields for start and end times (UTC), timezone, source (manual or
   * automated), and confirmation or proposal status. Operation ensures that the
   * referenced interview exists and is active, and checks for time conflicts to
   * prevent overlapping or duplicate booking. Only users assigned as
   * participant roles (HR, applicant, techReviewer) for this interview may
   * invoke this operation.
   *
   * Upon creation, the slot is checked to confirm it does not conflict with
   * existing slots for the interview, and will fail gracefully with a
   * meaningful error if there are duplications or the referenced interview is
   * not eligible for new scheduling. The record stores the reason for any
   * cancellation or status update (e.g., rescheduled, cancelled, confirmed).
   *
   * Security: Only authorized HR recruiters, related applicants, or tech
   * reviewers can add schedules. All invocations are logged in audit trails for
   * compliance and traceability. Related operations are PUT (update slot),
   * DELETE (cancel slot), and PATCH (list slots for interview).
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param interviewId Unique identifier of the target interview for which to
   *   create a new schedule.
   * @param body Details of the interview schedule slot to create, including
   *   start/end time, timezone, schedule source, participant data, and
   *   confirmation status.

  /**
   * Update an existing interview schedule slot for a given interview
   * (ats_recruitment_interview_schedules).
   *
   * This API operation updates details of an existing schedule slot for a
   * particular interview. Updatable fields include start_at, end_at, timezone,
   * schedule source, and schedule status or cancellation reason. It requires
   * checking that the interview and schedule both exist, are not deleted, and
   * are eligible for update according to the current status (e.g., slots that
   * are already confirmed as completed or cancelled cannot be updated).
   *
   * Validation rules enforce that the new slot time does not overlap with any
   * other slot linked to this interview, and that status transitions are
   * allowed per business policy (e.g., pending→confirmed, pending→cancelled).
   *
   * Security enforcement ensures that only participants (HR, related applicant,
   * techReviewer) associated with the interview or system administrators may
   * invoke this update. All updates are recorded in the audit trail for
   * compliance and subsequent event notification. Related operations are POST
   * (create slot), DELETE (cancel slot), and PATCH (list schedules).
   *
   * If the operation fails due to validation, proper error messages are
   * returned to guide the user (e.g., "proposed time conflicts with another
   * confirmed slot“).

   * @param connection
   * @param interviewId Unique identifier of the target interview.

  /**
   * Delete (cancel) a specific interview schedule slot for a given interview
   * (ats_recruitment_interview_schedules).
   *
   * This API operation removes or cancels a schedule entry for an interview,
   * marking it as deleted or cancelled in the database. The operation first
   * validates that the interview and associated schedule exist and are in a
   * modifiable state (not completed, not already cancelled). The operation
   * retains a soft-deletion pattern by setting the deleted_at field for audit
   * recovery; hard delete is not performed so that all schedule changes remain
   * traceable. A cancellation reason can be recorded as part of the process.
   *
   * This is restricted to HR recruiters, technical reviewers, or system
   * administrators linked to the interview. Any attempt to delete a
   * non-existent or already-completed/cancelled slot results in a business rule
   * error, with details returned to the caller.
