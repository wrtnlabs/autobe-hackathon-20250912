   * any interview's questions, while applicants may only view their assigned

  /**
   * Update a specific interview question for a given interview session

   * question ID and parent interview ID. The target table is

   * assigned to an interview instance for an applicant.
   *
   * Updates can include the question text, its type (such as technical or
   * behavioral), template status, or its display order during the interview.
   * The operation checks user roles to ensure only permitted HR or technical
   * reviewers can modify questions. Each update is automatically logged for
   * traceability and audit trail compliance, which is essential for ATS systems
   * that must support audit-ready processes.
   *
   * Appropriate validation is performed to ensure the referenced interview and
   * question IDs exist, the user has the correct permissions, and no state
   * constraints (e.g., interview already completed) are violated. Related
   * endpoints, such as assigning new questions or retrieving the interview's
   * full question list, may be used together with this operation to provide a
   * comprehensive interview workflow.
   *
   * Error responses are returned if the requested question or interview do not
   * exist, if the user lacks authorization, or if the update would violate
   * business rules (such as editing a locked/completed interview). All changes
   * are tracked for audit and rollback if necessary.

   * parameters. The system accesses the ats_recruitment_interview_questions
   * database table, which links individual questions to interview instances.
   *
   * When a valid deletion request is issued, the targeted question is
   * permanently deleted from the database, meaning it will no longer appear in

   * Authorization checks are performed to ensure that only HR recruiters or

   * may remove a question.

   * completed or locked interview session. All delete actions are logged for
   * audit compliance, and errors are returned in cases where the specified
   * interview or question does not exist, or if the requester lacks privileges.

   * for questions in the schema—once deleted, recovery is not possible.
