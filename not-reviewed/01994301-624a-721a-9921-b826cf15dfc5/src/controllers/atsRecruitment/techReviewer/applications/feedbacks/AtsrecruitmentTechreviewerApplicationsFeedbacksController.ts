   * feedback body, rating, and the recommendation status fields.

   * This feedback mechanism enhances transparency in the candidate evaluation
   * process and supports structured collaboration among HR recruiters and

   * feedback combination to prevent duplicate entries for the same reviewer and
   * application.
   *
   * This operation directly interacts with the
   * ats_recruitment_application_feedback table as defined in the Prisma schema,
   * populating all relevant columns. Access to this endpoint is controlled to
   * ensure only designated reviewers (HR, technical reviewers, or authorized
   * admins) can submit feedback for an application. Business logic includes
   * validation of the application existence, reviewer eligibility, and correct
   * feedback data structure. Error handling provides responses for unauthorized
   * access, validation failures, or constraint violations (such as duplicate
   * feedback).
