   * Retrieve the details of a coding test review comment by ID for a given

   * reviewers, HR staff, or system admins to display the content, review type,
   * timestamps, and reviewer identification of a single comment for
   * moderation/audit purposes.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint should be restricted according to applicant privacy
   * and reviewer authorization rules, as review comments may contain sensitive
   * evaluation notes. Security checks must ensure the requesting actor is
   * permitted to view the review comment (e.g., must be the assigned tech
   * reviewer or HR of the job posting), as per platform policy.
   *
   * Referenced database columns include the immutable review comment text,
   * comment_type (e.g., 'manual', 'auto', or 'system'), timestamps for when the
   * comment was started and finalized, and the reviewer ID. The operation draws
   * from the ats_recruitment_coding_test_review_comments schema and supports
   * compliance by enabling audit of reviewer feedback and the integrity of the
   * review process.
   *
   * This endpoint is intended to be used after listing available review
   * comments for a submission (via listing endpoint), or when directly
   * accessing a comment from a moderation or feedback workflow UI. Error
   * handling must clearly distinguish not found, forbidden, or deleted
   * resources, returning appropriate error codes and audit logging all access
