   * Filters also allow for searching active vs. deleted (soft-deleted) resumes
   * as needed.

   * Permissions are restricted by user role: HR recruiters and system admins
   * can access all resumes, while applicants may only view their own data (via
   * a different endpoint). Search results support performance requirements for
   * large datasets and are optimized for list UI presentation.
