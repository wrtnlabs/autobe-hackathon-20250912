   * Delete a technical reviewer (techReviewer) account from the ATS system by

   * This API operation is used to delete a technical reviewer (techReviewer)
   * account record from the ATS system by its unique ID. The purpose of this
   * endpoint is to allow for system administrator-initiated account removal in
   * response to turnover, withdrawal, or privilege revocation events.
   *
   * Security measures ensure only authorized system administrators are
   * permitted to perform this sensitive action, and all requests should be
   * logged in the audit trails for compliance auditing. Deletion permanently
   * removes the tech reviewer from authentication and assignment flows; the
   * system must ensure that remaining records (e.g. code reviews, interview
   * histories) reference the deleted user as an orphaned record where
   * appropriate, or handle as business exception.
   *
   * Special consideration should be given to dependencies on interviews, review
   * comments, and IT audit reportingâ€”these associations must not be silently
   * lost or misattributed post-deletion. Implementers must enforce strong
   * permission checks, mandatory audit trail creation, and pre-checks before
   * executing the removal. Deletion is irreversible and must be confirmed by
   * privileged administrators.
