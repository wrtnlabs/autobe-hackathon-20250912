   * Search and view paginated list of notification failure records

   *
   * This endpoint allows authorized users (primarily system administrators and
   * possibly HR recruiters) to search and view the history of notification
   * delivery failures for a given notification. Notification failures record
   * each case where a notification could not be delivered through its intended
   * channel, including details such as failure type, error message, timestamp,
   * and associated delivery attempts.
   *
   * The operation supports search and filtering by various attributes such as
   * failure type, recipient channel, delivery status, message pattern, and date
   * ranges. Results are paginated for efficient review. This enables analysis
   * of recurring notification issues, tracking compliance with alerting
   * policies, and facilitating remediationâ€”such as resending or escalation.
   *
   * Access to failure records is typically restricted to admin roles due to
   * sensitivity around notification content and error data, and all queries are
   * logged for compliance.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param notificationId Unique identifier of the notification whose failures
   *   are being queried.
   * @param body Search/filter and pagination parameters for notification
   *   failure records.

  /**
   * Get details of a notification failure record

   *
   * This endpoint fetches the complete detail of a particular notification
   * failure event that occurred for a notification, as indexed by
   * 'notificationId' and the specific failure's 'failureId'. The record
   * includes information such as the failure mode (e.g., provider error,
   * invalid address, user opt-out), detailed error message from the provider or
   * system, event timestamp, and related delivery.
   *
   * The data is used to conduct compliance reviews, debug notification delivery
   * issues, and document problem trends. Access is restricted to system
   * administrators due to the sensitivity and potential for exposure of
   * recipient contact or operational error details.

   * Error scenarios include non-existent notification/failureId or unauthorized
   * access. The operation is trace-logged for audit purposes. No request body
   * is required for this GET operation, and the result is a structured object

   * @param notificationId Unique identifier for the parent notification event.
