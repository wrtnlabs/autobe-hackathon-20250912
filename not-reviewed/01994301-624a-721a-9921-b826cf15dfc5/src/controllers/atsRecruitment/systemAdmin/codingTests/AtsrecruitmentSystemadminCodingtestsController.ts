   * This operation enables HR recruiters to create (assign) a new coding test
   * for a specific applicant, linked to a job application. The coding test
   * record tracks the application, applicant, HR recruiter who assigned the
   * test, the test provider (internal platform or an external provider such as
   * Programmers or CodeSignal), the provider's reference ID or URL, the
   * scheduled and deadline times, and the initial status.
   *
   * The coding test creation may trigger notifications to the applicant, as
   * well as setup of external service communication if using third-party
   * platforms, with proper callbacks enabled. All details of the test, such as
   * provider, test URL, delivery, and status, are maintained for later review
   * and audit. Scheduling rules, such as not allowing duplicate assignments for
   * the same application and applicant, are enforced as per business logic.
   *
   * The operation will return the full created coding test record including
   * IDs, provider, scheduling, and linkage fields. Authorization is required:
   * only HR recruiters or system administrators may perform this operation.
   * Errors may occur if referenced application or applicant does not exist, or
   * if business rules (e.g., duplicate test assignments or invalid schedule)
   * are violated.
