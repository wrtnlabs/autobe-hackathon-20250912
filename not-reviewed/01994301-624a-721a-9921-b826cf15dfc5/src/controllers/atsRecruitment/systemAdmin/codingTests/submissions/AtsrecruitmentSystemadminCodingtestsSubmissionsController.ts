   * This endpoint permanently deletes a coding test submission record from the
   * system using the provided codingTestId and submissionId, referencing the
   * ats_recruitment_coding_test_submissions table. This operation is typically
   * available before the submission is reviewed or in rare compliance scenarios
   * requiring data removal.

   * (such as after final review), and full audit/reporting is performed for
   * compliance.

   * post-operation. Related endpoints include submission retrieval, update, and
   * status advances for other workflow states.
