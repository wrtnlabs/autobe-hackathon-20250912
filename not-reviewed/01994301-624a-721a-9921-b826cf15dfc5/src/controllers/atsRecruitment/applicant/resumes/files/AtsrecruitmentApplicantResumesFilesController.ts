   * Upload or replace a resume file for an existing applicant resume
   * (ats_recruitment_resume_files).
   *
   * This API operation allows applicants to upload a new or replacement file to
   * their resume by targeting an existing resume record. The file must comply
   * with policy constraints—only PDF and DOCX file types are accepted, files
   * must not exceed 10MB, and each resume can have only one current file
   * attached (replacing prior uploads).
   *
   * For security and auditability, the operation records metadata including
   * original filename, permanent object storage URI, extension, file size, and
   * upload timestamp on the ats_recruitment_resume_files table. Upon uploading
   * a new file, any existing file record for this resume is replaced according
   * to the unique constraint on ats_recruitment_resume_files. Resume parsing,
   * OCR/AI analysis, and applicant data extraction workflows may be triggered
   * asynchronously after upload.
   *
   * Authorization ensures that only the resume's owner (applicant) can upload
   * files to their resume. Attempting to upload files with disallowed
   * extensions or oversized files will yield validation errors. Upload actions
   * are captured for compliance, and file metadata is available for subsequent
   * resume parsing and analysis automation. Typical error handling includes
   * guidance for unsupported format, over-size, or unexpected server errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param resumeId The unique identifier of the resume to which the file will
   *   be attached or replaced.
   * @param body Resume file metadata and storage details for upload (PDF/DOCX,
