   * Retrieve a specific interview question for a given interview from

   *
   * Retrieve a specific interview question assigned to a particular interview.
   * This operation is used by HR recruiters, tech reviewers, or an applicant
   * participant (when permitted) to access the detailed content and properties
   * of an interview question as configured for a scheduled or historical
   * interview in the recruitment process.
   *
   * The endpoint validates both the interviewId and questionId path parameters,
   * ensuring correct association (questionId must belong to interviewId).
   * Content includes question order, type (e.g., behavioral, technical,
   * coding), actual question text, and template/manual status. Role-based
   * authorization is enforced ( only hrRecruiter and techReviewer can access
   * any interview's questions, while applicants may only view their assigned
   * interview's questions, subject to further security policies).
   *
   * The implementation must ensure secure handling, as some questions may
   * contain sensitive assessment information or AI-generated content. Related
   * operations include listing all questions for an interview, creating
   * additional questions (for HR/techReviewer only), and updating interview
   * question content (where permitted).
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param interviewId UUID of the interview containing the question.
   * @param questionId UUID of the interview question to retrieve.
