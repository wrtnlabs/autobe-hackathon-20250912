   * Fetch full detail of a single job posting (ats_recruitment_job_postings)
   * identified by jobPostingId, including all principal business fields and
   * relations (such as assigned HR recruiter and employment type/state
   * details). This operation is used across both applicant- and HR-facing
   * business flows for viewing job requirements, descriptions, location, salary
   * range, deadlines, and presentation metadata.
   *
   * Authorization is enforced to restrict access to non-public postings: HR
   * recruiters and system administrators may access all jobs, while applicants
   * and the public are limited to is_visible set jobs. Access control is
   * handled in implementation logic. Attempts to retrieve a deleted
   * (soft-deleted) posting will result in a not-found or forbidden response.
   *
   * Returned data structure conforms to the IAtsRecruitmentJobPosting
   * interface, reflecting every non-sensitive field as present in the schema
   * for full compliance and audit trail purposes.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param jobPostingId The unique identifier (UUID) of the target job posting
   *   to retrieve.
