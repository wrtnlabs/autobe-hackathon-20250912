   * Search and retrieve a paginated, filterable list of enum values from

   *
   * Retrieve a filtered and paginated list of enumeration (enum) values
   * registered in the ATS recruitment platform for business code lookup,
   * dropdowns, and validation. This operation allows searching by enum_type
   * (such as application_status, notification_channel), enum_code (unique
   * code/constant for business logic), label (UI-visible string), and
   * sorting/pagination/filtering as needed.
   *
   * Only enum values that are not soft-deleted (deleted_at IS NULL) are
   * included in listings. The fields available for query include: enum_type
   * (category), enum_code (business code), label (for UI), description, and any
   * optional extended_data for metadata.
   *
   * This endpoint is open to all authenticated users and may be called by both
   * backend services and client UIs to dynamically construct dropdowns and
   * validation lists. Sensitivity of some enums (if any) should be managed with
   * business logic in the implementation layer; schema-level access is not
   * restricted. The operation is read-only and never exposes secrets. Standard
   * pagination and search conventions apply. Related endpoints include
   * single-enum retrieval (GET /enums/{id}) and enum creation/update
   * (admin-only).
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Complex filter/search and pagination criteria for enum list
   *   retrieval.

   * value), extended_data (optional metadata for UI/widgets), description
   * (usage context), and audit fields created_at/updated_at.

   * This operation is typically used for client-side data population, lookup,
   * and data integrity validation. No secrets or confidential business logic is
   * contained in the enum values. Access is open to all authenticated users and
   * may be public if business logic allows. Only non-deleted (deleted_at IS
   * NULL) enum records can be returned; otherwise, the response is null or
   * error.
   *
   * Related endpoints: paginated search/filter (PATCH /enums), enum
   * creation/update (admin only). Error handling includes not-found, deleted,
   * or invalid-id cases. All audit trail and data correctness constraints are
