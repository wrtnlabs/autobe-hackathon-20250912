   * technical reviewer to request a fresh AI/NLP/skill-extraction job for the
   * provided resume. The data includes analysis_type (e.g., "basic_ocr",

   * in the ats_recruitment_resume_ai_analyses schema.
   *
   * Upon validation, the system creates a new analysis job record which is
   * processed asynchronously. The endpoint ensures only authorized actors
   * (owner HR/tech reviewer) can schedule new analyses. Typical use cases
   * include re-running failed/older analyses, forcibly updating skills or
   * contact parsing, or batch-processing resumes. Business rules govern maximum
   * frequency and enforce audit logging.
   *
   * On success, the response returns the detailed created job record, including
   * status, type, and analysis metadata. Errors include unauthorized access or
   * business rule violations (e.g., repeated requests too soon).
