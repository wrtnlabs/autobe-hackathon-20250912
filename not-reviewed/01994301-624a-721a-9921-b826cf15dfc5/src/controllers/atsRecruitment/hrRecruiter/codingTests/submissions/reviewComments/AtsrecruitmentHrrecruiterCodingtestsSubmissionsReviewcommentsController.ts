   * Retrieve the details of a coding test review comment by ID for a given
   * coding test submission.
   *
   * This API retrieves all details of a specified review comment associated
   * with a particular coding test submission. It can be used by technical
   * reviewers, HR staff, or system admins to display the content, review type,
   * timestamps, and reviewer identification of a single comment for
   * moderation/audit purposes.
   *
   * Access to this endpoint should be restricted according to applicant privacy
   * and reviewer authorization rules, as review comments may contain sensitive
   * evaluation notes. Security checks must ensure the requesting actor is
   * permitted to view the review comment (e.g., must be the assigned tech
   * reviewer or HR of the job posting), as per platform policy.
   *
   * Referenced database columns include the immutable review comment text,
   * comment_type (e.g., 'manual', 'auto', or 'system'), timestamps for when the
   * comment was started and finalized, and the reviewer ID. The operation draws
   * from the ats_recruitment_coding_test_review_comments schema and supports
   * compliance by enabling audit of reviewer feedback and the integrity of the
   * review process.
   *
   * This endpoint is intended to be used after listing available review
   * comments for a submission (via listing endpoint), or when directly
   * accessing a comment from a moderation or feedback workflow UI. Error
   * handling must clearly distinguish not found, forbidden, or deleted
   * resources, returning appropriate error codes and audit logging all access
   * for compliance.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param codingTestId Unique identifier for the coding test to which the
   *   review comment belongs.
   * @param submissionId Unique identifier for the coding test submission
   *   associated with this review comment.
   * @param reviewCommentId Unique identifier for the review comment being
   *   retrieved.

   * Search and retrieve a paginated, filtered list of coding test review
   * comments for a specific submission.
   *
   * This API provides a way to retrieve a filtered and paginated list of all
   * review comments associated with a specific coding test submission, enabling
   * team members to audit, moderate, or collaboratively evaluate the
   * applicant's coding test. The request body may include search terms,
   * reviewer filters, date ranges, or comment type, supporting flexible UX
   * scenarios for reviewing or audit.
   *
   * Comments are returned ordered by commented_at descending, but support
   * additional sort options. The response includes pagination, total count, and
   * a list of matching review comments, as per the
   * ats_recruitment_coding_test_review_comments schema. Security rules ensure
   * that only authorized tech reviewers (those assigned), HR for the
   * corresponding job posting, or system admins can access the list, with full
   * audit logging of all data accesses.
   *
   * The endpoint is not intended to return the full coding test or submission
   * content, only the review comment metadata and content fields. Error
   * handling distinguishes between no results, forbidden access, and deleted
   * resources. Related endpoints include creation, single retrieval, and
   * deletion of comments.
