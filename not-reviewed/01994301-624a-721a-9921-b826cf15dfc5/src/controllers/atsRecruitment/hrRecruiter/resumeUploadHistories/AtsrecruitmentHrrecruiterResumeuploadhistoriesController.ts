   * Retrieve a paginated, filterable list of resume upload histories from the
   * ats_recruitment_resume_upload_histories table. This endpoint is used by HR
   * recruiters and system administrators to audit all uploads and modifications
   * to applicant resume files. It is also accessible to applicants for
   * reviewing their own upload records.
   *
   * The operation leverages indices on applicant ID, upload_timestamp, and file
   * metadata for fast access and supports advanced search (by date range,
   * applicant email/name, file extension, file size, IP address, etc). This is
   * critical for uncovering compliance anomalies, supporting GDPR requests to
   * trace file usage, and for forensic history during disputes or security
   * audits.
   *
   * Sensitive information such as applicant details must be filtered based on
   * caller's authorization. Only system admins can retrieve all histories,
   * while HR recruiters are restricted to job-related applicants, and
   * applicants may only see their own uploads. The operation provides upload
   * provenance, enables tracking multiple upload/replacement cycles, and
   * ensures robust file history retention. Large result sets are paginated to
   * support compliance-scale reporting.
