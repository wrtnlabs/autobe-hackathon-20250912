   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of job applications

   * This endpoint enables authorized users (HR recruiters/system
   * administrators) to conduct advanced queries to list all job applications
   * currently registered in the ATS platform. The underlying Prisma model
   * (ats_recruitment_applications) links applications to applicants, job
   * postings, and resumes and features fields such as current_status,
   * submitted_at, and last_state_change_at for filtering, sorting, and paging.
   *
   * Business logic supports filtering applications by status (e.g., submitted,
   * screening, code_test), applicant info, posting title, submission period,
   * and related job attributes to facilitate workflow orchestration. Requests
   * may include search terms, filters, page size, and sorting options
   * encapsulated in the request body. Security restrictions ensure applicants
   * only see their own records, while hrRecruiter and systemAdmin roles have
   * broader system management permissions.
   *
   * This operation supports business analytics, SLA tracking, and helps
   * administer the recruitment funnel, allowing bulk actions, reporting, and
   * export integration. Errors are handled for non-existent filter values or
   * excessive query ranges, with compliance considerations for personal data
   * access.

   * @param body Search, filter, pagination, and sorting parameters for job
   *   application listing.

   * comply with valid foreign key references (e.g., resumeId must refer to a

   * consistent with allowed business transitions and overall data integrity.
