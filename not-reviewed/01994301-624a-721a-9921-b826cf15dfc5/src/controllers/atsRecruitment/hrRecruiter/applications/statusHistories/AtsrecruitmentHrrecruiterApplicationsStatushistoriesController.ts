   * Create a new status history record for an application
   * (ats_recruitment_application_status_histories table).
   *
   * This operation allows an authorized HR recruiter or designated tech
   * reviewer to create a new status history record for a specific job
   * application. This is primarily used for logging any transition of the job
   * application state (such as moving from 'screening' to 'interview', or
   * marking an application as 'accepted' or 'rejected').
   *
   * On successful execution, a record is created in the
   * ats_recruitment_application_status_histories table, detailing which
   * application was affected, which actor performed the status change, the
   * states transitioned from and to, the timestamp, and any additional
   * transition comment. Access is restricted to users with HR or reviewer roles
   * to ensure that unauthorized users cannot forge application state changes.
   * Business logic may enforce allowed transitions according to the
   * organizationâ€™s workflow rules and reject invalid transitions.
   *
   * As an auditable entity, this status history is used for compliance,
   * analytics, and transparency within the recruitment platform. All changes
   * are timestamped and associated with actors to support workflow forensics
   * and application lifecycle reporting. On error, validation checks ensure the
   * application exists and the user has proper permissions. Related endpoints
   * include viewing all status histories for an application and updating an
   * existing record if correction is needed.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param applicationId Unique identifier of the job application for which the
   *   status history is being created.
   * @param body Information about the new status transition, including previous
   *   and new status values, the actor (if provided), timestamp, and optional
   *   comment.
