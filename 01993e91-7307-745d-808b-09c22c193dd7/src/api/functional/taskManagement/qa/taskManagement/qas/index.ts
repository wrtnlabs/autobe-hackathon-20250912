/**
 * Delete a QA user by ID from task_management_qa table permanently.
 *
 * This API operation permanently removes a Quality Assurance (QA) user from the
 * system based on their unique identifier. It targets the 'task_management_qa'
 * table, which manages comprehensive QA user data including login credentials
 * (email, password hash) and personal metadata.
 *
 * Security is crucial as QA accounts have specific role-based access
 * permissions for managing and updating task statuses and reporting bugs.
 *
 * The operation performs a complete deletion rather than a soft delete despite
 * the nullable deleted_at field in the schema, removing all QA user data
 * irreversibly. It expects the caller to have appropriate administrative
 * permissions.
 *
 * Upon successful execution, the QA user record identified by the path
 * parameter 'id' is deleted permanently. If the user is not found or
 * unauthorized, appropriate error responses should be returned.
 *
 * This API complements user management endpoints for other user roles such as
 * TPM, PM, Developer, Designer, and PMO.
 *
 * No request body is necessary, and the response does not include a body.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.id The unique identifier of the QA user to delete
 * @path /taskManagement/qa/taskManagement/qas/:id
