## 1. User Message

> Create a simple library management system where users can:
> - Add books with title, author, and ISBN
> - View all books and search by title

## 2. Assistant Message

> To create your simple library management system, I want to make sure I understand exactly what you need.
> 
> You want users to be able to:
> 1. Add books with title, author, and ISBN.
> 2. View all books.
> 3. Search books by title.
> 
> Before proceeding, can you please clarify a few things?
> - Will users have accounts or login, or is this a simple open system?
> - Should the system allow deleting or updating books later, or just adding and viewing/searching?
> - For searching by title, should it be partial matches (e.g., search "Potter" finds "Harry Potter") or exact matches only?
> - Do you want a web API, a command line tool, or some other interface?
> - Are there any other features or constraints you have in mind?
> 
> This will help me gather sufficient details to plan the system accurately.

## 3. User Message

> Your Responses: 1. User Accounts: No user accounts or login required - make it an open system where anyone can add and view books. 2. Book Management: Only support adding and viewing books. No need for deleting or updating functionality. 3. Search Functionality: Support partial matching for title searches (e.g., searching "Potter" should find "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"). 4. Interface Type: Create a RESTful API with standard HTTP endpoints. 5. Additional Features: No additional features or constraints - keep it as simple as possible.
