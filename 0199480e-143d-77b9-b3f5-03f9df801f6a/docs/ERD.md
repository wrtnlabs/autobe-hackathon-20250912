## Actors

```mermaid

"library_management_guestusers" {
  String id PK
  DateTime created_at
  DateTime updated_at
  DateTime deleted_at "nullable"
}
```

### `library_management_guestusers`

Guest user role representing unauthenticated users who can add, view, and
search books. This table stores minimal identity information for guest
users. It serves as a primary identity entity without authentication
credentials. This entity is primarily to support access control in the
Actors domain, isolated from main business entities to ensure clean
domain separation.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the guest user record was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the guest user record was last updated.
- `deleted_at`: Soft delete timestamp allowing recovery of guest user records.
