# Appointment and Scheduling Flows for Healthcare Platform

## Scheduling Overview

The healthcarePlatform aims to provide robust, production-grade appointment and scheduling capabilities for multi-tenant healthcare organizations—including hospitals, clinics, and private practices. Scheduling must enable seamless coordination between patients, providers (doctors, nurses, technicians), and resources (rooms, equipment), supporting both in-person and telemedicine appointments. All scheduling processes shall respect organizational isolation, HIPAA compliance, audit trails, and provide a responsive, self-service experience for all user roles as defined in [User Roles and Authentication](./02-user-roles-and-authentication.md).

### Appointment Types and Business Objectives
- Standard provider appointments (in-person/outpatient, consultations, procedures)
- Telemedicine/video consultations with pre-scheduled or on-demand options
- Multi-resource and multi-provider bookings (e.g., surgery teams, equipment, rooms)
- Patient self-service scheduling with real-time availability

### Scheduling Performance Requirements
- THE scheduling module SHALL display real-time availability and booking options to all users with relevant access within 2 seconds of request.
- THE scheduling flows SHALL support 10,000+ concurrent active scheduling sessions without data collision or double-booking.
- THE system SHALL allow patients to view, book, modify, or cancel their appointments through the patient portal, in English or Spanish.
- All scheduling transactions SHALL be logged with full audit trails including timestamp, user, intent, and success/failure outcome.

### Organizational and Compliance Boundaries
- THE platform SHALL ensure complete data isolation when scheduling between different healthcare organizations, departments, and roles.
- IF an unauthorized user attempts to view or book appointments outside their allowed scope, THEN THE system SHALL deny the request and log the event for audit review.

## Resource and Provider Booking

### Coordinate Providers, Rooms, and Equipment
- WHEN a provider, staff member, or patient initiates a new appointment, THE system SHALL present real-time provider and resource availability based on user’s organization and department context.
- THE scheduling module SHALL support concurrent bookings across multiple providers, rooms, and equipment, enforcing organizational, departmental, and resource-level constraints.
- WHEN an appointment is created involving restricted resources (such as surgical rooms or specialized equipment), THE system SHALL enforce proper authorization, approval workflows, and booking window lead times.
- THE system SHALL support complex recurrence rules (e.g., physical therapy sessions every Monday/Wednesday for 6 weeks) and integrate with existing calendar systems for providers.
- WHERE recurring or group appointments are supported, THE system SHALL maintain all instances in synchronization and automatically propagate approved changes.

### Waitlists and No-Shows
- WHEN a requested time slot is unavailable, THE system SHALL offer to add the requestor to a waitlist and notify them if and when a slot becomes available.
- THE no-show process SHALL be managed by marking missed appointments and enabling rescheduling or follow-up workflows as per organizational policy.

### Booking Validation, Conflicts, and Error Handling
- IF a resource becomes unavailable due to an emergency or maintenance, THEN THE system SHALL automatically attempt to re-route appointments, notify stakeholders, and log the incident.
- IF a booking conflict is detected (time/resource/staff overlap), THEN THE system SHALL prevent the booking, display specific validation errors, and offer alternative options.
- THE system SHALL enforce maximum and minimum booking windows, cancellation periods, and reschedule limits as configured by each organization or department.

```

## Telemedicine Journeys

### Telemedicine Session Setup
- WHEN a telemedicine appointment is requested, THE system SHALL offer video platform selection (in-house or integrated third party per organization policy), secure link generation, and device compatibility checks for both patient and provider.
- THE telemedicine workflow SHALL allow pre-session documentation upload (e.g., symptoms, insurance), virtual check-in process, and secure chat prior to video start.
- WHERE telemedicine sessions require consent (e.g., video recording, digital records), THE system SHALL enforce display and acceptance of proper consent forms before session initiation.
- WHEN the video visit is initiated, THE system SHALL log the entry/exit times, session metadata, participant list, and any technical issues reported.

### Recording, Privacy, and Security
- WHERE organizations enable recording, THE system SHALL implement patient/provider opt-in workflows and clearly communicate the storage duration and access controls for session recordings.
- IF a telemedicine provider cannot join (e.g., network failure), THEN THE system SHALL escalate the case to a backup provider queue or offer immediate patient rescheduling.
- THE platform SHALL ensure all video and chat data transmission is encrypted end-to-end, logged for compliance, and tied to the appointment’s audit log.

```

## Reminders and Follow-ups

### Automated Reminders
- WHEN an appointment is scheduled, modified, or canceled, THE system SHALL send automated notifications to the patient and provider via configured channels (SMS, email, patient portal messages, with language localization).
- THE system SHALL send reminders at pre-configured intervals (e.g., 24 hours and 2 hours before appointment) as per organizational and patient communication preferences.
- WHERE a patient confirms or cancels an appointment via reminder, THE system SHALL update the appointment status in real time and notify the provider.
- IF a reminder notification fails (e.g., invalid contact), THEN THE system SHALL attempt alternate channels (if enabled), log the event, and present actionable error to the relevant staff.

### Follow-up Scheduling and Workflows
- WHEN an appointment outcome requires a follow-up (e.g., check-up post-surgery, lab results review), THE provider or nurse SHALL be prompted to schedule a recommended follow-up per specialty guidelines.
- THE system SHALL track missed/declined follow-ups and alert care teams for appropriate next steps (e.g., outreach or documentation of patient decline).

```

## Business Rules and Validation Logic
- THE system SHALL strictly enforce appointment quotas, overlapping limits, and maximum resource utilization per provider, department, and location.
- ALL changes to schedules (create/update/cancel) SHALL be subject to audit logging with user and timestamp.
- THE appointment system SHALL allow organizational administrators to configure booking windows, lead/cancellation times, allowed appointment types, and notification preferences.
- IF a system-level or integration outage prevents scheduling operations, THEN THE system SHALL gracefully degrade, provide user feedback, and offer to contact staff for manual support.

## Output and Notification Requirements
- All outputs (success, conflict, error, waitlist, reminders) SHALL be presented in the user’s preferred language and time zone context, ensuring compliance with patient privacy and communication best practices.
- THE scheduling module SHALL provide real-time dashboard summaries for providers and admins showing today’s appointments, resource utilization, and exceptions.
- All error responses MUST be actionable, explaining both the cause and the recovery options to the end user or staff.
