# User Roles and Authentication Requirements: Enterprise Healthcare Platform

## User Roles Overview
The healthcarePlatform service defines a strict, multi-level role structure for secure, compliant, and efficient operations across multiple healthcare organizations. Each role below is characterized in terms of business responsibilities, access, and organizational context:

| Role               | Description                                                                                                           | Organizational Context         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| System Administrator | Full system access across all organizations. Oversees infrastructure, integrations, analytics, and compliance. Responsible for deployment, security, global audit.                       | Platform-wide/global           |
| Organization Administrator | Administers a given healthcare organization. Manages staff, facilities, billing, regulatory reporting, and all internal workflows for one tenant.                         | Per healthcare organization    |
| Department Head    | Supervises a clinical/operational department (e.g., Cardiology, Emergency) within an organization. Manages staff, schedules, department analytics, and resource allocation.                | Per department/organization    |
| Medical Doctor     | Provides direct patient care. Authorizes prescriptions, views/updates full patient records, orders diagnostics, reviews results, and initiates treatments.                              | Per department/organization    |
| Nurse             | Delivers clinical care, records vitals, administers medication (as directed), coordinates care, and communicates with patients. Limited record modification under approval workflows.       | Per department/organization    |
| Technician         | Executes technical/diagnostic tasks (imaging, labs), uploads and annotates medical data, manages technical workflows, and views relevant orders.                                      | Per department/organization    |
| Receptionist      | Handles appointment scheduling, patient check-in/out, non-clinical patient data entry, and administrative inquiries.                                   | Per organization/department    |
| Patient           | End user who manages their own health records, schedules appointments, communicates securely with care teams, and manages insurance/billing.                                  | Per organization              |


## Authentication Requirements

- THE system SHALL require secure authentication for all users before accessing any non-public functionality.
- WHEN a user initiates login, THE system SHALL support:
    - Email/password authentication with minimum password complexity and lockout on repeated failed logins.
    - SSO integration with SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, and Active Directory for enterprise users.
    - Direct verification of medical professionals with NPI Registry and relevant state boards during onboarding and at regular intervals.
- WHEN authentication is successful, THE system SHALL issue a session and access token valid for a business-configured period (default: 30 min, extendable by refresh mechanism up to 7-30 days for ongoing care sessions).
- THE system SHALL enforce session expiration, forced logout after configurable inactivity, and allow revocation of all sessions per user or administrator action.
- WHEN a user requests password reset, THE system SHALL require a secondary form of verification (e.g., email, phone, verified SSO) before granting access.
- WHERE an organization requires, THE system SHALL support multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all staff and administrator roles.
- THE system SHALL support automated and manual deprovisioning of user accounts, with full audit trail for each authentication and session event.

⚠️ Limited-privilege or subject to approval workflow.

### EARS Format Requirement Examples
- WHEN a patient requests access to their health data, THE system SHALL verify consent and scope before providing access.
- WHEN a nurse submits an update to a patient record, THE system SHALL require approval from a Medical Doctor or Department Head.
- WHEN a doctor prescribes medication, THE system SHALL trigger drug interaction and allergy checks before allowing prescription completion.
- WHEN a receptionist schedules an appointment, THE system SHALL restrict access to non-clinical patient demographics and approval-required resources.
- WHERE emergency override is triggered, THE system SHALL log all actions and initiate post-incident review by compliance officers.
- IF user attempts to access data outside their permission scope, THEN THE system SHALL deny access and log the attempt for auditing.
- THE system SHALL allow patients to revoke consent for record sharing at any time, with full audit history.


## Access Control Policies

- THE system SHALL enforce absolute data separation between organizations (multi-tenant architecture) such that users, staff, and all resources are visible only to their home organization/department unless explicitly permitted under policy (e.g., cross-organization consultations).
- WHERE cross-organization data sharing is required, THE system SHALL require explicit patient and administrative consent, with clear recording of access scope, reason, and approver identity.
- THE system SHALL ensure that permission elevation (e.g., temporary emergency access, department transfer) requires structured approval and is fully auditable.
- WHEN emergency access is needed (e.g., medical crisis), THE system SHALL allow designated staff to override normal access, log the event in detail, and require a compliance review afterward.
- WHEN a role is removed or user terminated, THE system SHALL immediately revoke all active sessions and remote access points for that user.
- THE system SHALL support organization-specific configuration of feature access, such as limiting patient portal capabilities or messaging by locale or regulatory region.
- WHERE consent management policies apply, THE system SHALL enable patients to grant, restrict, or revoke data sharing/communication at any time via the portal.


## Audit and Compliance Requirements

- WHEN any user accesses, modifies, exports, or shares patient health information (PHI), THE system SHALL record the actor, timestamp, data accessed, action, access reason (where applicable), and consent status in a non-repudiable audit log.
- THE system SHALL provide complete audit trail retrieval by authorized compliance and security personnel, with data retention for at least 10 years and automated archiving after 2 years.
- THE system SHALL support periodic (configurable frequency) compliance reviews, anomaly detection (e.g., failed logins, unusual access patterns), and configurable alerting.
- WHERE possible breaches or policy violations are detected, THE system SHALL notify designated officers immediately and support investigation workflow via the audit log.
- THE system SHALL be designed to meet HIPAA requirements for access control, audit trails, breach notification, and role-based data minimization. The system SHALL be adaptable for future SOC 2 Type II certification.

```

## Business-Driven Error Handling and Compliance

- IF authentication fails, THEN THE system SHALL display an explicit business-relevant error (e.g., "Invalid credentials", "Account suspended", "License verification failed") and log the attempt.
- IF user session or token is expired or revoked, THEN THE system SHALL require re-authentication and show a clear session timeout message.
- IF a user attempts to access functionality beyond their assigned permissions, THEN THE system SHALL present an access denied message and capture the event in the audit trail.
- IF emergency override is triggered, THEN THE system SHALL immediately display prominent notifications to all involved staff and compliance personnel.
- THE system SHALL ensure that audit log entries are immutable, tamper-evident, and accessible only to authorized compliance or audit staff.

## Performance and User Experience Requirements

- WHEN authentication is successful, THE system SHALL allow access to the user dashboard within 2 seconds (p95 across all users/roles).
- THE system SHALL allow high-concurrency (5,000+ users per tenant) without perceptible login or role-based navigation delays.
- IF third-party enterprise identity provider is temporarily unavailable, THEN THE system SHALL display a non-technical, business-relevant error and advise fallback/alternate methods if available.
- THE system SHALL offer zero-downtime maintenance for authentication flows via blue/green deployments or similar strategies (responsibility: System Admins/Developers).
