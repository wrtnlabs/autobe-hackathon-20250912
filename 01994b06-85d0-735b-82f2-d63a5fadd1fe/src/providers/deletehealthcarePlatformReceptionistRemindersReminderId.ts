/**
 * Soft delete a healthcare platform reminder by reminderId as receptionist.
 *
 * This operation marks the specified reminder as deleted (soft delete) by
 * updating the 'deleted_at' timestamp, making it non-active for further
 * workflows and queries. It strictly enforces business rulesâ€”reminders that are
 * already deleted, finalized, or compliance-locked are protected from deletion.
 * Only authenticated receptionists may execute this operation. The change is
 * fully auditable for compliance without physically removing the record,
 * complying with regulatory and retention requirements.
 *
 * @param props - The parameters for this operation
 * @param props.receptionist - The authenticated receptionist performing the
 *   delete
 * @param props.reminderId - The UUID of the reminder to delete
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If the reminder is not found, already deleted, or cannot be
 *   deleted due to business rules
