/**
 * Logically delete (erase) a compliance consent by ID (soft delete with audit
 * trail).
 *
 * This operation allows an organization admin to revoke a compliance consent
 * record by logically deleting it: the consent's deleted_at field is updated
 * with the current system timestamp (ISO8601 string, branded). No hard deletion
 * is performed, and the record is retained for regulatory audit. Only allows
 * deletion for consents that exist, are not already deleted/revoked, and are
 * not expired. Organization admin must exist and be valid.
 *
 * If the consent record is not found, has already been deleted, or has expired,
 * a business error is thrown. All actions are fully auditable.
 *
 * @param props - Operation props
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - The authenticated organization admin
 *   performing the operation
 * @param props.complianceConsentId - The unique identifier of the compliance
 *   consent to delete
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the consent does not exist, is already deleted, is
 *   expired, or the admin is not valid
