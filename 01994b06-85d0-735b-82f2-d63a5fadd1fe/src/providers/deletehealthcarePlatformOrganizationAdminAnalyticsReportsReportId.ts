/**
 * Permanently delete an analytics report by reportId from the
 * healthcare_platform_analytics_reports table (hard delete).
 *
 * Enables authorized organization administrators to delete a specific analytics
 * report, as identified by reportId, from the platform. This operation performs
 * a hard delete of the analytics report record in the
 * healthcare_platform_analytics_reports table and immediately removes its
 * dashboard/reporting presence in business workflows.
 *
 * Compliance, audit, and business policy are strictly enforcedâ€”attempts to
 * delete reports that are locked or referenced in regulatory or active
 * analytics workflows will raise an error and log the incident for review.
 * Every delete action is recorded in the audit trail for compliance and
 * accountability. Hard delete is performed as no soft delete field is present
 * in this Prisma schema for analytics reports.
 *
 * @param props - Request parameter object
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - Authenticated organization administrator
 *   session (OrganizationadminPayload)
 * @param props.reportId - UUID of the analytics report to hard delete
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the report does not exist
 * @throws {Error} When the admin does not own the report (organization
 *   mismatch)
