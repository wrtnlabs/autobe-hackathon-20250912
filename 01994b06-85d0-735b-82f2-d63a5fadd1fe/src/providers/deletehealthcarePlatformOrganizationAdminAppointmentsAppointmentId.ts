/**
 * Delete (soft) an appointment by ID in healthcare_platform_appointments table
 *
 * Deletes (soft delete via deleted_at field) an appointment by unique
 * identifier. The method enforces access control so only authorized roles
 * within the appointment's organization/department may mark it deleted.
 * Business logic checks include: existence, reference integrity, and protection
 * for appointments involved in billing or legal workflows.
 *
 * Upon success, the appointment is removed from active schedules and workflows
 * but is retained for audit and compliance. Attempts to erase an appointment
 * outside the userâ€™s permitted scope or on protected records (e.g., closed
 * billing, locked by compliance) return appropriate errors. All delete actions
 * are logged in the audit subsystem.
 *
 * @param props - Object with the authenticated organization admin user and
 *   appointmentId
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - The authenticated organization admin payload
 * @param props.appointmentId - Unique appointment uuid
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If appointment does not exist, is already deleted, user is
 *   not authorized, or protected references prevent deletion
