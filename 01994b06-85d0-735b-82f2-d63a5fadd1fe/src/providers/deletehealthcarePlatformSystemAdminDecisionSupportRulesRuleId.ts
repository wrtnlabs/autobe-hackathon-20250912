/**
 * Permanently delete a clinical decision support rule by ruleId from the
 * healthcare_platform_decision_support_rules table.
 *
 * This operation performs a hard deleteâ€”irreversibly removing the specified
 * clinical decision support (CDS) rule by its UUID. Only system administrators
 * can invoke this function. Deletion is auditable and generates a corresponding
 * audit log record, capturing the administrator's identity, target rule
 * details, and the operation timestamp.
 *
 * Downstream data (such as generated clinical alerts) is not affected by this
 * operation.
 *
 * @param props - Operation parameters
 * @param props.systemAdmin - Authenticated system administrator payload (must
 *   be a valid admin)
 * @param props.ruleId - Unique identifier of the CDS rule to be deleted (UUID)
 * @returns Void (the rule is deleted)
 * @throws {Error} If the specified ruleId does not exist in the database, an
 *   error is thrown.
 * @throws {Error} If the operation fails or the user is not authorized
 *   (enforced by decorator).
