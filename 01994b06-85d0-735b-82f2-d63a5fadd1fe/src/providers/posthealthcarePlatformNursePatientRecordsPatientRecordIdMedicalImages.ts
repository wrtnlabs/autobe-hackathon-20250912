/**
 * Upload a new medical image and associate it to the given patient record
 * (healthcare_platform_medical_images table).
 *
 * Creates a new medical image record under the specified patient record,
 * storing metadata (e.g., type, modality, acquisition details), a URI to the
 * uploaded image, and references to the uploading technician and parent EHR
 * encounter. Upon successful creation, the system triggers audit trail entries,
 * optionally notifies relevant care team members, and links the file to the
 * encounter for downstream clinical review.
 *
 * Only authorized healthcare professionals (nurse in this endpoint) may invoke
 * this operation. Strict validation ensures the parent patient record exists
 * and is accessible by the uploading user, the uploaded file meets type/format
 * requirements, and referenced entities are not soft deleted. Uploads are fully
 * audited for compliance.
 *
 * @param props - Operation parameters
 * @param props.nurse - Authenticated nurse payload (must be active)
 * @param props.patientRecordId - Unique identifier of the parent patient record
 *   (UUID)
 * @param props.body - Metadata and secure file URI for the uploaded medical
 *   image
 * @returns Full metadata and reference for the newly created medical image
 *   entity
 * @throws {Error} If any referenced entity does not exist or is deleted, or if
 *   image_type is not allowed, or if access or policy violation
