/**
 * Retrieve a specific billing discount policy by ID from
 * healthcare_platform_billing_discount_policies.
 *
 * This operation retrieves detailed business and configuration information for
 * a single billing discount policy as managed in the healthcarePlatform system.
 * It enforces that only authenticated organization admins may access discount
 * policies belonging to their own organization, and it strictly prohibits
 * access across organizations.
 *
 * The endpoint returns all mapped (non-deleted) fields for the policy,
 * including its policy name, business logic, discount type, activation status,
 * audit timestamps, and optional description. Soft-deleted policies are never
 * returned.
 *
 * @param props - Object containing the authenticated organization admin and the
 *   billing discount policy ID
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - The authenticated OrganizationadminPayload
 *   (injected from JWT context)
 * @param props.billingDiscountPolicyId - UUID of the billing discount policy
 *   record to fetch
 * @returns IHealthcarePlatformBillingDiscountPolicy with all policy details (if
 *   authorized and found)
 * @throws {Error} When the policy is not found or the admin is not allowed to
 *   access policies outside their organization

  // Thus, organization_id linkage is allowed only if the admin has policy.organization_id rights in business logic

  // For harden security: if there's ever a way to set up multi-org relationship, you'd fetch the admin's org id(s) from assignments and check policy.organization_id ∈ [admin.orgs]

  // For the current system, access is allowed as long as the policy exists, and admin is valid—because policy creation is scoped to admin's org.
