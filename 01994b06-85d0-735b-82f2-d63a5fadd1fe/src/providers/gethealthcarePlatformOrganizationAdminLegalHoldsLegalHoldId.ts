/**
 * Get details of a HealthcarePlatformLegalHold entity by legalHoldId.
 *
 * This endpoint fetches the details for a specific legal hold entity by its
 * unique identifier, returning full record fields such as organization,
 * subject, status, method, reason, effective and release windows, and
 * compliance associations.
 *
 * The operation is accessible only to organization admins, with all access
 * audited for regulatory compliance. Data returned supports downstream
 * compliance review, internal or external audit, and legal workflows. Errors
 * may occur for permission violations, non-existent or deleted records, and
 * access outside organization bounds.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - The authenticated organization admin user
 *   making the request
 * @param props.legalHoldId - The unique identifier for the desired legal hold
 *   record (UUID)
 * @returns The complete legal hold record matching the requested id, mapped to
 *   API structure
 * @throws {Error} When the admin cannot access the record due to permission or
 *   if it does not exist
