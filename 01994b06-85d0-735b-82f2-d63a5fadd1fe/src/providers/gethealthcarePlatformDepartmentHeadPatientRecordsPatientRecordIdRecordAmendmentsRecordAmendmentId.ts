/**
 * Get full details of a specific record amendment on a patient record

 * Retrieve clinical, audit, and amendment workflow metadata for a specific
 * patient record amendment. Enforces patient-record scope, validates existence,
 * and (if possible) restricts access to department context as required for
 * compliance and audit review. Exposes all metadata required for regulatory and
 * workflow traceability, subject to audit boundaries as enforced by RBAC
 * logic.
 *
 * Access is permitted for department heads only for amendments belonging to
 * patient records within their departmental assignment. Errors are thrown on
 * not-found or access violations. Department-level RBAC is documented as a
 * limitation due to missing join.
