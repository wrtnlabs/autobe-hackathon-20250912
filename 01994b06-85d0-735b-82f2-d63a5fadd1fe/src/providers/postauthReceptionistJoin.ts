/**
 * Register a new receptionist and issue initial JWT tokens
 * (healthcare_platform_receptionists)
 *
 * This endpoint allows a new receptionist user to register an account on the
 * healthcarePlatform by providing required fields such as email and full_name.
 * Registration is subject to unique email enforcement and triggers creation of
 * a new receptionist entity in the 'healthcare_platform_receptionists' table.
 * Upon successful registration, a JWT token pair (access and refresh) is
 * issued, enabling authenticated participation in appointment management and
 * non-clinical administrative workflows.
 *
 * NOTE: According to the API/operation spec, a mechanism for credential
 * creation (password) is required, but IHealthcarePlatformReceptionist.ICreate
 * does NOT provide a password field, making it impossible to create user
 * authentication entry. This is a contradiction between input interface and
 * business requirements.
 *
 * To resolve this contradiction, this implementation currently returns
 * typia.random<IHealthcarePlatformReceptionist.IAuthorized>(). When the input
 * structure is fixed to include an authentication credential, this logic must
 * be revisited to perform actual registration, credential creation, and token
 * generation.
 *
 * @param props - Object containing registration payload
 * @param props.body - Receptionist details as per
 *   IHealthcarePlatformReceptionist.ICreate (missing password field per spec!)
 * @returns Authorized receptionist payload (mocked, see above)
 * @throws {Error} When required business fields for authentication are missing
 *   from input spec
