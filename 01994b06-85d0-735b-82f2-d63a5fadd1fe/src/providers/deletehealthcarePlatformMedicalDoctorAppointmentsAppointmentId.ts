/**
 * Deletes (soft deletes) an appointment by unique identifier.

 * This function enforces role-based access control, referential integrity, and
 * compliance hold constraints. It marks the appointment as deleted (by
 * populating deleted_at) if the user is authorized, the appointment exists and
 * is not already deleted, no finalized billing or active legal hold are
 * present. Deletes are logged in the audit subsystem. Attempts to delete
 * non-existent, protected, or unauthorized appointments will throw errors.
 *
 * @param props - Object containing required parameters.
 * @param props.medicalDoctor - Authenticated MedicaldoctorPayload for the
 *   acting provider.
 * @param props.appointmentId - Unique identifier of the appointment to delete.
 * @returns Void
 * @throws Error - When appointment does not exist or is already deleted.
 * @throws Error - When user is not the assigned provider for the appointment.
 * @throws Error - When appointment is referenced in finalized billing.
 * @throws Error - When appointment is under legal hold.
