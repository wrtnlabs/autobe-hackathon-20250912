/**
 * Create a new user-organization assignment
 * (healthcare_platform_user_org_assignments).
 *
 * Creates a new user-organization role assignment, mapping the given user to an
 * organization and role with the provided assignment status. Ensures
 * enforcement of organization-admin boundaries, role assignment rules,
 * duplicate prevention, and correctness of business entity mappings. All dates
 * are returned as ISO-8601 strings; no native Date types present anywhere in
 * the function signature or implementation. All required audit and validation
 * steps are performed.
 *
 * @param props - Object containing the authenticated organization admin and the
 *   assignment body
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - The authenticated organization admin payload
 *   (organization scoped)
 * @param props.body - Assignment creation input ({ user_id,
 *   healthcare_platform_organization_id, role_code, assignment_status })
 * @returns The created assignment record with all fields populated (dates as
 *   ISO8601 strings)
 * @throws {Error} If assignment violates org boundary, user/org not found,
 *   duplicate exists, or fails business policy
