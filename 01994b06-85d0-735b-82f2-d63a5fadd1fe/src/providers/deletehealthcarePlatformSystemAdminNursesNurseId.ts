/**
 * Soft delete (archive) a nurse record in healthcare_platform_nurses by ID.
 *
 * This endpoint enables a privileged system administrator to logically (soft)
 * delete a nurse record by marking the 'deleted_at' field. No physical deletion
 * is performedâ€”soft deletion respects compliance/audit rules, allowing
 * retention for future review or restoration if needed.
 *
 * Only system admins (SystemadminPayload) may perform this action. An error is
 * thrown if the nurse does not exist or is already deleted. The deleted_at
 * timestamp is set using a safe ISO 8601 string. All business logic and access
 * control is handled within this function in a functional, immutable,
 * production-safe style without native Date type or type assertions.
 *
 * @param props - Object containing a valid system admin payload and the nurseId
 *   (UUID) for the nurse to delete
 * @param props.systemAdmin - Authenticated system admin performing the
 *   operation
 * @param props.nurseId - Unique nurse ID (UUID format) to be soft deleted
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the specified nurse does not exist or is already
 *   deleted; authorization handled by decorator
