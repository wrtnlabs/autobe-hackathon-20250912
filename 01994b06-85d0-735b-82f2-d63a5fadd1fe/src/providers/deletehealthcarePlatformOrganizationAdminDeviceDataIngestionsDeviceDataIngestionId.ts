/**
 * Permanently delete a device data ingestion configuration, specified by its
 * unique ID, from the healthcare_platform_device_data_ingestions table.
 *
 * This operation is used when a device integration is decommissioned, failed,
 * has been replaced, or poses compliance risk. The operation ensures that the
 * configuration and its endpoint are removed from the system, stopping future
 * data flows and maintaining a clean administrative and compliance surface.
 * Deletions are fully reflected in the audit trail as required for medical
 * device compliance and operational accountability.
 *
 * This operation is restricted to roles with high privilege (systemAdmin,
 * organizationAdmin). Attempts to delete a nonexistent or inaccessible record
 * (from wrong organization or insufficient RBAC) will result in error responses
 * specifying the cause. There is no undelete; removal is immediate and
 * permanent within the active database.
 *
 * @param props - The parameters for this operation
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - The authenticated organization admin
 *   performing the deletion (OrganizationadminPayload)
 * @param props.deviceDataIngestionId - The UUID of the device ingestion
 *   configuration to delete
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If the admin does not exist or is deleted
 * @throws {Error} If the ingestion configuration is not found or already
 *   deleted
 * @throws {Error} If the ingestion configuration is not accessible by this
 *   organization admin
