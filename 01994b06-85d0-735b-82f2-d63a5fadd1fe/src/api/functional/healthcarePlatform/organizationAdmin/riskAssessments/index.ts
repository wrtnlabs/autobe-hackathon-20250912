 * Create a new risk assessment record in the

 *
 * Create a new risk assessment entry in the
 * healthcare_platform_risk_assessments table based on the supplied details.
 * Risk assessments document compliance, operational, or technical risk reviews
 * performed by or on behalf of an organization or department.
 *
 * This endpoint allows authorized users (compliance, platform, or organization
 * administrators) to submit new assessments covering type, status, methodology,
 * scope, findings, level, analysis period, and recommendations. Input is
 * validated according to the IHealthcarePlatformRiskAssessment.ICreate schema
 * and includes all necessary metadata required for subsequent audit or
 * reporting workflows.
 *
 * Upon successful processing, the new risk assessment is stored and returned in
 * the response body. Post-creation, the record is available for auditing,
 * reporting, updating, and assignment of reviews as dictated by compliance
 * policy.
 *
 * Proper audit logging of the creation actor, timestamp, and context is
 * mandatory to meet regulatory and internal business requirements. Related
 * operations include updating or retrieving specific assessments, and listing
 * all assessments for compliance tracking.
