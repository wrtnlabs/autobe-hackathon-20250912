 * This endpoint is intended for use by authorized organization admins and

 * performs either a soft or hard delete based on the presence of a 'deleted_at'
 * column: here, as per the Prisma schema, deleted_at is present, so the
 * operation will set this timestamp instead of physically removing the record
 * to fulfill audit and compliance requirements.
 *
 * The operation validates that the department is not under legal hold or audit
 * lock and that there are no in-progress resources or active assignments that
 * would block deletion. All dependent records are handled per defined
 * referential integrity policies (cascading, restriction, etc.) as specified in
 * the underlying Prisma schema.
 *
 * When successful, the department is marked as deleted (with 'deleted_at' set),
 * effectively removing it from active lists but preserving it for compliance
 * retention and recovery. A robust error handling process informs users if
 * deletion is forbidden, blocked by business logic, or if the department does
 * not exist.
