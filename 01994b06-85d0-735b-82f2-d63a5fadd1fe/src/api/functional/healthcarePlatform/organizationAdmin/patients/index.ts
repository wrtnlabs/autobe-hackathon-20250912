/**
 * Register a new patient user profile in healthcare_platform_patients.
 *
 * Register a new patient user profile in the platform, capturing required
 * demographic and identity information as defined in the
 * healthcare_platform_patients table. Required fields include email, full name,
 * and date of birth, with phone as optional. The POST operation validates input
 * for uniqueness (especially email), regulatory standards, and readiness for
 * audit trail logging. It integrates with downstream patient workflows,
 * including appointments, billing, and consent management, as well as security
 * and notification preferences.
 *
 * Role-based access ensures that both staff (such as receptionists and
 * organization admins) and patients (via self-service registration) can create
 * accounts as permitted by business policy. Error handling covers duplicate
 * email, invalid input, and compliance failures, with all creations subject to
 * audit and legal traceability. The response returns the created patient
 * profile and links it to the organization's patient record domain for further
 * operations and workflow integration.
