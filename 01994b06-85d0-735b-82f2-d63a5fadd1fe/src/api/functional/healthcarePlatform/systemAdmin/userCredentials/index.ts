/**
 * Archive a new user credential value record in the
 * healthcare_platform_user_credentials table.
 *
 * This operation allows system or organization administrators to archive a new
 * credential for any user or actor covered by the healthcarePlatform's
 * authentication system. The request captures user_id, user_type (systemAdmin,
 * orgAdmin, etc.), credential_type (password, sso, certificate, webauthn,
 * etc.), credential_hash (the credential value, typically hashed), and relevant
 * timestamps.
 *
 * Archiving user credentials supports regulatory mandates, SSO rotation
 * policies, and password reuse prevention. Credential archive entries are
 * append-only and must never be edited after creation. Sensitive values, such
 * as credential_hash, must be handled securely; cleartext must never be
 * allowed. All creation events are logged to the audit trail for security and
 * compliance needs.
 *
 * Attempting to create a credential archive entry for a non-existent or
 * unauthorized user must result in a compliance-audited error. Only authorized
 * systemAdmin or organizationAdmin roles should be allowed to use this
 * endpoint.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.body Credential record including user_id, credential type, and
 *   credential hash.

 * application constraints (e.g., password hash structure if used, or external
 * SSO details for SSO-type credentials). Related endpoints for credential
 * history retrieval or credential creation may be referenced to ensure proper
