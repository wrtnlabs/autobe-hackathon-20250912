 * Add a waitlist entry for a patient to a specific appointment (join waitlist).

 * Patients may self-join the waitlist for an appointment that is currently
 * full; authorized staff can add patients on their behalf in accordance with
 * scheduling policy.
 *
 * Business rules validate that a patient cannot be waitlisted more than once
 * per appointment, and that organization, department, and appointment status

 * join time and current status set per schema documentation. Sensitive patient
 * information, if present in the request, is only processed by authorized
 * roles.
 *
 * Implements compliance with organizational scheduling policies and privacy
 * protections, with all events creating audit logs as enforced by the
 * healthcare platform's business rules. Errors are returned if the appointment
 * does not permit further waitlisting or if business policy is violated.
