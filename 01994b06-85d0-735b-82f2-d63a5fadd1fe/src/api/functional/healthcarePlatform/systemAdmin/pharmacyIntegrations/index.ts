/**
 * Get configuration details for a specific pharmacy integration by ID
 * (healthcare_platform_pharmacy_integrations).
 *
 * This operation returns all configuration details for the given pharmacy
 * integration record, as defined in the
 * healthcare_platform_pharmacy_integrations table. The primary purpose is to
 * enable organization administrators or IT/security staff to view provider
 * credentials, endpoint URIs, communication protocols, and status for
 * integration with external pharmacy systems such as Surescripts or NCPDP.
 *
 * With a valid pharmacyIntegrationId, the endpoint returns information
 * including the pharmacy vendor code, connection URI, supported protocol, and
 * the operational status of the integration. It does not expose or return
 * sensitive secrets, only connection metadata and linkage for deployment and
 * monitoring.
 *
 * Access is restricted to users with configuration or integration management
 * privilegesâ€”typically orgAdmin or systemAdmin. Unauthorized users will receive
 * an access denied response with a corresponding audit log entry. The endpoint
 * will validate the pharmacyIntegrationId as a UUID and return a 404 error if
 * not found. Integrations that are logically deleted (soft deleted via
 * deleted_at) are excluded unless specifically requested by audit workflows.

 * connections) are enforced in provider logic.
