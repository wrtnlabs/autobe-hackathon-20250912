   * This operation is used by highly privileged system administrators and
   * organizational compliance officers to search, monitor, and review long-term
   * audit log archives. Each record represents a batch of historical audit data
   * that has been moved into regulated cold storage, with strict metadata
   * tracking required by HIPAA, SOC 2, and organizational policies.
   *
   * The operation allows for advanced filtering by archive type, organization
   * context, archive creation/internal date windows, and retention period
   * endpoints. Pagination and sorting support enable efficient review of large
   * volumes of long-term audit data archives. Only users with appropriate
   * platform or org-level compliance permissions can access this endpoint.
   *
   * Business validations in the request may include validation of the
   * organizationâ€™s compliance status and data retention policies, ensuring only
   * authorized access and valid organization/archive context. The resulting
   * data is critical for external audits, compliance inspections, and legal
   * proceedings.

   *   archive records.
