   * Search and retrieve a paginated list of clinical alert records that have
   * been generated by the healthcare platform's decision support engine. This
   * endpoint accesses the healthcare_platform_clinical_alerts table and
   * provides advanced query capabilities for filtering by alert status (new,
   * viewed, acknowledged, resolved), organization, department, CDS rule ID,
   * user assignment, date/time ranges, and alert type (warning, info, critical,
   * recommendation).
   *
   * The operation supports business logic for role-based visibility, with
   * system admins able to search all alerts, organization admins limited to
   * their organization, and department heads or assigned users able to see
   * alerts scoped to their departments or individuals. The response includes
   * alert details, status, subjects, timestamps, and escalation status.
   * Pagination and sorting options allow efficient access to high-volume alert
   * data. Comprehensive audit trails exist for alert access and search to
   * support HIPAA compliance and incident investigations.
   *
   * Validation ensures the requester has necessary permissions, criteria are
   * well-typed, and search results are filtered per data isolation rules. Error
   * handling covers malformed queries, excessive result sets, and authorization
   * failures.
   *

   * Upon status update, the system records a compliance audit event and may
