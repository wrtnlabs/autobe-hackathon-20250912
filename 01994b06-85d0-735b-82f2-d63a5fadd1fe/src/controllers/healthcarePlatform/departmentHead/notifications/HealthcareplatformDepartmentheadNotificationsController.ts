   * Search and retrieve notifications with advanced filtering and pagination
   * (Notifications table).
   *
   * This API operation provides a comprehensive, advanced search endpoint for
   * retrieving notifications issued in the healthcarePlatform system.
   * Leveraging the Notifications table and utilizing all available filtering
   * and sorting options, the operation supports multi-tenant, role-aware
   * searches by notification type (e.g., appointment reminder, billing alert),
   * delivery channel (email, SMS, in-app), criticality, status, recipient,
   * sender, and more.
   *
   * All search criteria—including pagination, sorting parameters, criticality
   * flag, status codes, and date ranges—are encapsulated in the request body,
   * which is validated against the Notifications schema comments for correct
   * use. Output is paginated, providing summary data for each notification
   * (IDs, types, status, timestamps, subject, body preview, and metadata for
   * display purposes).
   *
   * Security policies are strictly enforced; the caller only receives
   * notifications for which they are authorized, according to organization,
   * role, and privacy configuration. Sensitive notification bodies are
   * appropriately redacted or omitted for unauthorized parties. The
   * implementation makes use of JSONB/Gin indexes and supports highly
   * responsive search even in high-volume environments.
   *
   * Related APIs: individual notification retrieval, notification creation, or
   * acknowledgement operations. Error handling covers invalid search criteria,
   * forbidden access, and pagination range errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Notification search and filter criteria, including pagination
   *   and sort options.

   * and context do not match privacy and compliance policies. All access
