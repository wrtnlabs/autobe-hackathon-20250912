   * details such as the linked organization, lab integration, import timestamp,
   * parsing outcomes, and error diagnostics.

   * Advanced search parameters may include organization or lab integration ID,
   * parsed status, import date ranges, or error strings, supporting operational

   * authorized staff with organization-level permissions, as the data often
   * contains sensitive process metadata.
   *
   * This endpoint complements single-record retrieval APIs and supports batch
   * review of lab data import health, error patterns, and facilitates root
   * cause analysis when integration problems arise. Errors in filter criteria
   * result in parameter validation responses, and proper pagination ensures
   * system scalability.
