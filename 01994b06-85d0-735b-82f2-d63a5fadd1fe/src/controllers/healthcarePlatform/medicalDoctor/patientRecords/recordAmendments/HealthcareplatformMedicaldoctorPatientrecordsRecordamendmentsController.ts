   * Create a new record amendment for a patient record.
   *
   * Create a new amendment to a patient record. Clinical staff, nurses, or
   * compliance officers may initiate an amendment when errors, updates, or
   * regulatory requests are identified. The operation requires a comprehensive
   * payload including type, rationale, before/after values, and related
   * encounter or reviewer if necessary.
   *
   * Security enforcement ensures only users with requisite clinical or
   * compliance roles within the organization/department may submit new
   * amendments. Business logic validates amendment feasibility, duplication,
   * and triggers review if required for certain amendment types (e.g.,
   * diagnosis, allergy). Soft delete markers on the patient record are checked
   * for compliance.
   *
   * Upon success, the operation returns the newly created amendment, which
   * reflects current workflow status (pending, approved, rejected), linkage to
   * the patient and potentially to an EHR encounter, and retains full audit
   * traceability. Failures (validation, permission, or constraint errors) will
   * return detailed reasons, especially in regulatory or review-required cases.
   * This endpoint supports the full amendment workflow lifecycle for medical
   * and audit compliance.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param patientRecordId Target patient record to which the amendment applies
   * @param body Full amendment creation data, including amendment type,
   *   rationale, old/new state, and optionally encounter or reviewer ID
