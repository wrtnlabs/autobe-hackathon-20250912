  /**
   * Erase a patient waitlist entry from a specific appointment (hard delete,

   *
   * This API operation is used to delete (hard erase) a patient's waitlist
   * entry from a specific appointment's waitlist in the healthcarePlatform
   * system.
   *
   * It is primarily intended for administrative staff, receptionists, or system
   * automations where a patient no longer needs to remain on the waitlist
   * (e.g., patient schedules elsewhere, is promoted, or cancels their
   * interest). The operation ensures compliance by fully removing the waitlist
   * record from the healthcare_platform_appointment_waitlists table, which does
   * not feature a soft delete marker—deletion is permanent and cannot be
   * recovered.
   *
   * Security considerations: Only authorized staff or automation with
   * sufficient privileges may perform this operation. The action is auditable
   * and would typically be recorded in the platform’s audit log under
   * appointment management workflows.
   *
   * Validation/business rules: Attempting to erase a non-existent or
   * already-deleted waitlistId yields a suitable error response. Erasures
   * associated with active appointments (still scheduled) are permitted;
   * removing waitlist entries for past/canceled appointments may have further
   * policy or audit consequences as per organizational configuration.
   *
   * Related operations: Staff may query all waitlist entries for an appointment
   * before erasing or remove multiple via separate API calls. This operation
   * only affects the targeted waitlist record for a given appointment.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param appointmentId Unique identifier of the target appointment for which

   * @param waitlistId Unique identifier of the patient's waitlist entry to be
