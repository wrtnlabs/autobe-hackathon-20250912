   * Search and retrieve a filtered, paginated list of payment methods
   * (healthcare_platform_billing_payment_methods table) available for billing
   * in the healthcare platform.
   *
   * This operation allows clients to search, filter, and retrieve available
   * payment methods used for billing operations in the healthcare platform.
   * Business scenarios include displaying payment method options on patient
   * portals, administrative UIs for configuring payment acceptance, and
   * analyzing supported providers for billing/invoice workflows.
   *
   * Full pagination is supported via request body parameters (page size,
   * offset, search query). Filtering by method type, provider, and status is
   * available as allowed by schema. The operation returns a list of summary
   * representations of payment methods, suitable for workflow selection or
   * display in user interfaces.
   *
   * Data returned is restricted based on access controlâ€”patients may only see
   * 'active' payment methods, while administrative users may see all, including
   * inactive or under configuration. The response is a paginated collection of
   * payment method summaries. Related endpoints include CRUD for payment
   * methods and payment processing operations. Error scenarios include invalid
   * search parameters or improper access scope.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Search and pagination criteria for billing payment methods.
