/**
 * End-to-end search of clinical alerts by department head with RBAC validation.
 *
 * This test validates that when a department head user is registered and
 * authenticated, subsequent queries to search (patch) clinical alerts are
 * strictly limited to those within the assigned organization (and optionally
 * department), in compliance with RBAC. Multiple filter scenarios are tested
 * (status, alert_type, department, rule, etc.). All results must respect
 * department/organization-bounded RBAC rules. Pagination metadata must align
 * with result content counts and limits.
 *
 * 1. Register (join) department head â€“ with correct org/department context
 * 2. Login as department head for a scoped authenticated session
 * 3. Issue a search for clinical alerts, applying multiple filters and validating
 *    results for:
 *
 *    - Proper inclusion of only department/org-bound alerts
 *    - All filters (status, department, alert_type, rule) properly restricting
 *         results
 *    - Pagination metadata and content matching as expected
 *    - All results comply with RBAC and no unauthorized department/org leaks
