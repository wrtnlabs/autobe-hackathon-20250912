- Multi-stage approval workflows SHALL be configurable.
- Localization and hierarchical tagging SHALL be supported.

## 5. Learning Path & Curriculum

- THE system SHALL provide AI-driven adaptive paths starting rule-based evolving to ML.
- Prerequisites and dependencies SHALL be enforced.
- Certification tracks with expiration and renewal.
- Competency mapping to skills and proficiency.
- Blended learning support including manual/API tracking of offline activities.

## 6. Assessment & Analytics

- Support quizzes, surveys, peer reviews, practical assignments, proctored exams via plugins.
- Dashboards for progress, engagement, trends.
- Predictive analytics for course success, competency, risk.
- Automated compliance reporting.
- Real-time notifications for deadlines and achievements.

## 7. Communication & Collaboration

- Moderated threaded forums.
- Secure direct messaging with file sharing and audit trails.
- Platform-agnostic live virtual classrooms.
- Collaborative group projects.
- Targeted announcements with delivery confirmation.

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- Access controlled by tenant, department, and role.
- Detailed progress tracking stored and reported.
- 7-year retention of training records in tiered storage with searchability.

## 11. Error Handling

- Clear messages for authentication failures, enrollment denials.
- Resumable uploads and retries for failures.
- Approval rejections notify creators.
- Notification delivery failures retried with alerts.

## 12. Security & Compliance

- Encryption, data privacy laws, certifications detailed.
- Role-based, attribute-based access control.
- Audit log management and retention.

## 13. Performance Expectations

- Concurrency, response times, streaming, caching, job queues.

## 14. Developer Autonomy
