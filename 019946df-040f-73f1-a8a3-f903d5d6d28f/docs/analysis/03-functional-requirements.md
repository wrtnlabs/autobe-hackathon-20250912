# Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) Functional Requirements Analysis

## 1. Introduction

The Enterprise LMS is designed as a scalable, multi-tenant training platform that supports complex organizational structures and advanced AI-powered learning personalization. It enables enterprises to manage learning content, certifications, compliance, and analytics across diverse learner populations.

## 2. Business Model

### 2.1 Why the LMS Exists
Many enterprises require centralized, compliant training solutions that can serve multiple organizations with strict data isolation. This LMS addresses the need for multi-tenancy with customized branding, AI-driven learning, and compliance reporting.

### 2.2 Revenue and Growth Strategy
The LMS generates revenue through enterprise subscriptions, paid certifications, and B2C course offerings. Growth will be driven by enhanced AI capabilities, integration with enterprise systems, and expanding global deployment.

## 3. User Roles and Authentication

### 3.1 Authentication Flow
Users SHALL authenticate securely via email/password or enterprise SSO using SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, or LDAP. Sessions SHALL expire after 30 minutes of inactivity. Password resets and email verification workflows SHALL be supported.

### 3.2 Role Hierarchy and Definitions
The roles include:
- System Administrator: Full system access including global configuration and integrations.
- Organization Administrator: Full organizational management including users, roles, billing, and content approval.
- Department Manager: Manages users and content within their department.
- Content Creator/Instructor: Creates and manages course content and learner progress.
- Corporate Learner: Enrolls, completes courses, views progress, and downloads certificates.
- External Learner: Accesses public and paid courses with limited rights.
- Guest: Browses course catalogs without enrollment capabilities.

### 3.3 Permissions and Access Control
The system SHALL implement RBAC and ABAC for granular, context-aware permissions customizable by Organization Admins, respecting system-wide minimum constraints.

## 4. Multi-Tenancy Architecture
The system SHALL enforce strict tenant isolation using a shared database schema with tenant_id identifiers. Tenants SHALL customize branding including logos, color schemes, custom domains, and CSS overrides stored in tenant settings.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 User Management & Authentication
Users SHALL be managed per tenant with strict data isolation. External learners MAY self-register with email verification; organizations can configure invite-only access. Audit logs SHALL capture all user actions.

### 5.2 Content Management
The CMS SHALL support videos, documents (PDF, DOCX, PPT), SCORM and xAPI packages imported and converted internally. Version control SHALL maintain unlimited versions with archival of older versions. Multi-stage, configurable approval workflows SHALL be supported. Localization and hierarchical tagging SHALL enhance content findability.

### 5.3 Learning Path & Curriculum Management
Adaptive learning paths SHALL start with rule-based recommendations, evolving into ML-driven personalization. Prerequisite enforcement, certification tracking with expiration/renewal, competency mapping, and blended learning (online/offline) SHALL be supported.

### 5.4 Assessment & Analytics Engine
Multiple assessment types (quizzes, surveys, peer reviews, assignments, proctored exams) SHALL be supported with third-party proctoring plugin options. The analytics dashboard SHALL provide comprehensive metrics and AI-based predictive analytics. Compliance reporting SHALL be automated.

### 5.5 Communication & Collaboration
Threaded discussion forums with moderation, secure direct messaging with file sharing and compliance, platform-agnostic virtual classrooms, group projects, and targeted announcements with delivery confirmation SHALL be implemented.

## 6. Business Rules and Validation
Enrollment SHALL be blocked unless prerequisites are met, with admin overrides logged. Certificates SHALL be issued only after successful assessments. Content access SHALL be restricted by tenant, department, and role. Detailed progress tracking SHALL be maintained. Data SHALL be retained for minimum seven years with tiered storage.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance targets include support for over 10,000 concurrent users per organization with 95% API requests responded under 200ms. Security requirements include AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, SOC2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance. Scalability requirements specify multi-region deployment, auto-scaling, database sharding, multi-layer caching, and asynchronous background job processing.

## 8. Integration Requirements
Integrations SHALL include Slack, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Workday, BambooHR, Stripe for payments, SendGrid/AWS SES for emails, AWS S3/Azure Blob for storage, and Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Tableau, PowerBI for analytics.

## 9. Error Handling
Clear error messages SHALL be provided to users. System SHALL retry failed integration requests. All failures SHALL be logged for auditing.

## 10. Security and Compliance
Requirements include data encryption, strong access controls, audit logging, strict multi-tenant isolation, regulatory compliance with GDPR, CCPA, FERPA, SOC2, ISO 27001, and incident response procedures.

## 11. Performance Expectations
Concurrency, low-latency responses, adaptive streaming, caching, and job queueing are addressed with measurable targets.

## 12. User Scenarios
Primary user journeys, exception handling, and notification flows are detailed.
