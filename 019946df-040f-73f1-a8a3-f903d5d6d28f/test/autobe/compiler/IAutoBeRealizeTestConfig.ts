/**
 * Configuration interface defining the essential execution parameters required
 * for comprehensive E2E test suite validation against fully implemented backend
 * applications.
 *
 * This interface encapsulates the core execution settings and control
 * parameters necessary to orchestrate the final validation phase of the AutoBE
 * development pipeline. It provides streamlined configuration options that
 * control test execution behavior, database management, and performance
 * characteristics without requiring direct access to implementation files or
 * database schemas.
 *
 * The configuration assumes that the test execution environment has been
 * pre-configured with all necessary resources including generated
 * implementation files, database schemas, and package dependencies. This
 * interface focuses solely on runtime execution parameters that control how the
 * test suite operates within the prepared environment.
 *
 * This lightweight configuration approach enables flexible test execution
 * across different environments while maintaining clear separation between
 * resource provisioning and execution control, supporting both development and
 * production validation scenarios.

   * proceeds with the current database state, which may contain residual data
   * from previous operations.
   *
   * Database reset is crucial for ensuring test isolation, reproducibility, and
