## User Message

I want to create chatting application. I am a newbie of programming, so create analysis requirements for this project

## Assistant Message

Great! Let's start by understanding your vision for the chatting application. I'll ask some simple questions to gather your requirements step by step.

1. What is the main purpose of your chatting app? (e.g., casual chat for friends, business communication, community groups)
2. Who will be the users? Will there be different roles like admin, regular user, guest?
3. What core features do you want? For example:
   - One-on-one messaging
   - Group chats
   - Sending pictures or videos
   - Notifications for new messages
4. Do you want users to register and log in? If yes, how should user authentication work (email/password, social login)?
5. Should the chat history be saved and viewable later?
6. Any other features or special requirements you have in mind?

Feel free to answer as simply as you like, and I can help clarify or explain any terms!

## User Message

community groups, regular user, one-on-one & group chats, social login

## Assistant Message

Thanks for the info! So, your chatting app is for community groups, with regular users as members. Core features include one-on-one messaging, group chats, and social login for user access.

To further clarify and complete the requirements, could you please tell me:

1. Do you want users to be able to create and join multiple community groups?
2. Should group chats have features like naming groups, adding/removing members, or assigning group admins?
3. Do you want to allow sending media like images or videos in chats?
4. Should chat history be saved so users can see past messages?
5. Would you like notifications for new messages or unread messages?
6. Any preferences on which social login providers to support? (e.g., Google, Facebook, Apple)

Feel free to add anything else you imagine for your app!

## User Message

1. yes, 2 naming groups, add/remove members, assign group admin 3. send image or video 4. save past messages 5. new message notification 6. snapchat preference

## Assistant Message

Thank you for the detailed answers! Here's what I have gathered for your chatting application requirements so far:

- Features:
  - Users can create and join multiple community groups
