# Error Handling and Recovery Requirements for StoryField AI Server

## 1. Introduction and Scope
This document defines business-driven requirements for the detection, handling, user notification, recovery, incident logging, and escalation of errors within the StoryField AI Server. The goal is to ensure reliability, user trust, and business continuity in all situations—from routine errors (invalid input or API limit exceeded) to critical system failures (unavailable external AI, backend/S3 outages).

Its scope covers:
- All user interactions with fairy tale generation (text/audio), image/text output, TTS/dialect features, and development/test APIs
- All integration points with the Spring backend, S3 storage, and external AI services
- All authenticated member experience, administrative oversight, and incident recovery processes

## 2. Business Impact of Failures
Failures in story generation, TTS, file storage, or authentication directly harm user satisfaction, risk eroding trust, and can impact monetization or reputation. Timely and transparent handling, with user-friendly feedback and robust recovery, is essential.

- **User Trust**: Poor error handling can result in user confusion, abandonment, or negative publicity
- **Revenue Impact**: Service downtime or lost work can decrease retention and impact revenue
- **Compliance Exposure**: Mishandling of data or failure notification may violate privacy rules

### Business Drivers for Robust Error Handling
- Maintain high user engagement and platform trust
- Ensure business continuity (minimize revenue loss due to downtime)
- Fulfill compliance obligations (handle data and notification per law)
- Support rapid investigation, rollback, and fix operations

## 3. User-Facing Error Handling Requirements
All requirements below use EARS format for clarity and testability.

### General Principles
- All user-visible errors must be actionable and understandable in natural language
- Technical details must never be shown to end users, but must be retained for logs

#### EARS Requirements
- THE 서비스 SHALL present a clear, friendly error message to users WHEN any recoverable error (such as invalid input, expired token, or AI generation failure) occurs.
- WHEN a non-recoverable failure occurs (e.g., persistent backend/S3 service outage), THE 서비스 SHALL inform users their request cannot be completed, and recommend retry or contact support.
- THE 서비스 SHALL provide meaningful guidance in error messages, explicitly stating resolution steps where possible (e.g., "Please log in again", "Try your request later").
- THE 서비스 SHALL ensure user error messages do not expose sensitive business or technical details (e.g., stack traces, internal IDs, keys).
- WHEN the user’s authentication token is expired or invalid, THE 서비스 SHALL inform the user they must re-authenticate before proceeding.
- WHEN input data is malformed, incomplete, or fails any validation, THE 서비스 SHALL present a descriptive error message specifying which field(s) require correction.
- WHEN generation or processing quotas (rate, usage limits) are exceeded, THE 서비스 SHALL display a message stating the user must wait or upgrade to continue, if applicable to business model.
- WHERE an error is expected to be temporary, THE 서비스 SHALL encourage users to retry later.

## 4. Automated Recovery and Retries
Error recovery expectations must be explicit, especially for transient or external errors.

#### EARS Requirements
- WHEN a recoverable, transient failure occurs during an external API call or file handoff (e.g., image upload fails, AI service times out), THE 서비스 SHALL attempt up to 3 automatic retries within a 10-second window before reporting an error to the user.
- WHEN automated retries succeed, THE 서비스 SHALL proceed as if the error never occurred, without disrupting user workflow.
- WHEN all automated recovery attempts are exhausted, THE 서비스 SHALL log the error and display a user-friendly notification of the degraded state (see Section 6).
- WHEN an administrative action (e.g., moderation, rollback) resolves a previously reported error, THE 서비스 SHALL mark the incident as resolved and, where possible, notify impacted users (e-mail or in-app).

## 5. Incident Logging and Escalation
Proper logging and escalation protect the business, aid rapid troubleshooting, and fulfill compliance obligations.

#### EARS Requirements
- THE 서비스 SHALL log all error events—including user actions, time, affected resources, error type, affected modules, and trace identifiers—while preserving user privacy.
- WHERE errors affect core user workflows, THE 서비스 SHALL escalate the incident to systemAdmin for review within 5 minutes, using notification channels (e.g., admin dashboard, email alert).
- WHEN a pattern of repeated errors occurs within a 15-minute window (threshold determined by business policy), THE 서비스 SHALL flag this as a potential incident and generate an incident report for further investigation.
- WHEN errors result in interrupted or incomplete story/TTS/image generation, THE 서비스 SHALL log sufficient context for administrators to diagnose and reproduce the failure without depending on user-provided details.
- IF a logging action fails (e.g., log server unavailable), THEN THE 서비스 SHALL store logs locally until central service resumes, then forward logs in batch.

### Logging Coverage Table
| Error Type                 | Logging Fields                          | Escalated To | Retention Policy |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| User Input/Validation     | userId, errorCode, field, timestamp     | No           | 90 days         |
| Authentication/Token      | userId, token, errorCode, timestamp     | Yes/No       | 90 days         |
| External API Failure      | userId, apiName, errorCode, retryCount, timestamp | Yes (critical) | 1 year         |
| S3/Backend Storage Error  | userId, fileName, operation, errorCode, timestamp | Yes (critical) | 1 year         |
| System Health/Critical    | affectedModule, status, errorCode, timestamp | Yes         | 2 years         |

## 6. User Feedback on Errors
Transparent, actionable user feedback fosters trust and product satisfaction.

- THE 서비스 SHALL ensure all user-facing error messages are written in clear, non-technical language appropriate for the user's locale.
- WHEN possible, THE 서비스 SHALL suggest actionable next steps in error messages tailored to the specific error event.
- WHEN a submitted operation results in lost progress (e.g., failed upload, dropped session), THE 서비스 SHALL clearly notify the user and, WHERE feasible, provide options for retry or recovery (e.g., "Restore draft").
- WHERE multiple errors are present in a single request (batch processing), THE 서비스 SHALL aggregate errors and inform the user of all affected items, not just the first failure.

### Example Error Message Table
| Scenario                                    | Example User Message                                   |
|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Authentication token invalid/expired        | "Your session has expired. Please log in again."      |
| Input validation failure                    | "Please provide a story plot before submitting."      |
| Audio file missing/corrupt                  | "Audio upload failed: your file appears corrupted."   |
| Generation quota exceeded                   | "You have reached your daily quota. Try again tomorrow." |
| External AI service unavailable             | "We're experiencing a technical issue. Please try later." |
| S3 storage/upload failure                   | "Could not save your images. Please try again later." |
| System-level outage                         | "Service temporarily unavailable. Contact support if repeated." |
| Technical error w/ retry in progress        | "We're retrying your request. Please wait a moment..." |

## 7. Performance Expectations for Error Handling
Efficient and timely error management is critical to service quality and user perception.

- THE 서비스 SHALL detect and handle routine/anticipated errors within 500 milliseconds of occurrence.
- WHEN an error is escalated to admin or triggers automated recovery, THE 서비스 SHALL begin handling/escalation within 1 second of detection.
- WHEN presenting errors to the user, THE 서비스 SHALL ensure user-visible feedback is delivered within 2 seconds of the triggering event.
- WHEN recovering from transient network/API errors, THE 서비스 SHALL attempt all automated retries and final error reporting within 12 seconds total (including 3 retries).
