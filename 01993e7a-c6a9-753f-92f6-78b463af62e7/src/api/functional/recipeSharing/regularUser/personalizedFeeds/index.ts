/**
 * Create a new personalized feed entry for a user.
 *
 * Create a new personalized feed entry that represents a recipe showing in a
 * user's feed. This operation allows associating a recipe to a specific user
 * feed so that the user can see content relevant to them.
 *
 * The creation enforces that the user receiving the feed, the recipe to
 * display, and the originator user who created the recipe are valid existing
 * entities. The database relations for user, recipe, and originator user are
 * maintained by this operation.
 *
 * Security-wise, only authenticated users should create personalized feed
 * entries, typically managed by server logic when users follow others or new
 * recipes are published.
 *
 * This operation inserts a new record into recipe_sharing_personalized_feeds
 * with all mandatory fields and timestamps for auditing. It ensures that the
 * feed entry is unique per user and recipe combination.
 *
 * The operation does not support manual approval or modification of feed
 * contents; it's intended for system-driven feed population.
