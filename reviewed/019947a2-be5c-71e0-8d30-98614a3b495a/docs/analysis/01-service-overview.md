# Chatting Application Requirement Analysis

## 1. Introduction

The chatting application is designed to facilitate communication within community groups by providing a secure, reliable, and user-friendly platform. It enables one-on-one messaging and group chats with multimedia support and social login capabilities, primarily targeting regular users who want to actively engage in their communities.

## 2. Business Model

### Why This Service Exists

Community members need a dedicated, easy-to-use chat platform that supports rich communication including media sharing, group management, and seamless authentication via social logins. The service fills the gap for community-centric messaging solutions that prioritize group collaboration and user engagement.

### Revenue Strategy

Although currently focused on user growth, potential revenue streams may include premium group features or advertisements integrated respectfully.

### Growth Plan

Growth is targeted via social login to minimize onboarding friction, community features that encourage viral adoption, and notification mechanisms to maintain high user engagement.

### Success Metrics

- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Average message volume per user
- User retention rate
- Group creation and active participation rates

## 3. User Roles and Authentication

### Roles

- Regular User: Authenticated user capable of creating/joining groups, sending messages, and managing group memberships if assigned admin rights.

### Authentication Requirements

- THE system SHALL allow users to authenticate via social login.
- WHEN a user attempts to log in, THE system SHALL support Snapchat as the preferred social login provider.
- THE system SHALL maintain user sessions securely with token-based authentication.

## 4. Functional Requirements

- THE system SHALL enable users to create multiple community groups.
- THE system SHALL allow users to join existing community groups.
- THE system SHALL support one-on-one messaging between users.
- THE system SHALL provide group chat functionality including:
  - Naming the group.
  - Adding or removing members by group admins.
  - Assigning group administrators.
- THE system SHALL allow users to send text messages, images, and videos.
- THE system SHALL persist chat messages to enable history retrieval.
- WHEN a new message is received, THE system SHALL notify the relevant user(s) promptly.

## 5. Business Rules and Validation

- Group administrators have the exclusive authority to rename groups and manage memberships.
- Only group members may send messages within that group.
- Messages SHALL be validated to ensure non-empty content.
- Media files SHALL conform to size and format restrictions.
- THE system SHALL secure all message histories.

## 6. Error Handling

- IF a user tries to join a non-existent group, THEN THE system SHALL return a clear error message.
- IF message sending fails due to network or server issues, THEN THE system SHALL retry sending up to three times.
- IF authentication errors occur, THEN THE system SHALL provide user-friendly error feedback and prompt re-authentication.

## 7. Performance Requirements

- THE system SHALL deliver messages within 2 seconds under normal network conditions.
- THE system SHALL notify users of new messages within 3 seconds.
- THE system SHALL support at least 100 concurrent users in a single group without performance degradation.

## 8. User Scenarios and Workflows

### Scenario 1: Joining and Messaging

A user logs in via Snapchat, searches for and joins a community group, then sends a message with an image attachment.

### Scenario 2: Group Administration

A group admin changes the group name and removes a member, with all actions promptly reflected for all group participants.

### Scenario 3: Offline Notifications and History

A user goes offline, receives notifications for new messages in groups, and upon reconnection accesses all missed chat history seamlessly.
