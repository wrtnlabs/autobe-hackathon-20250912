   * Retrieve a specific authentication session by ID for a user.

   * Retrieve a single authentication session record belonging to a regular

   * unique ID. This operation enables clients to query details such as OAuth2
   * access token, refresh token, expiration timestamp, and soft deletion

   * Security considerations require that only the owner of the authentication
   * session or authorized administrative roles may access these details,

   * database entity, ensuring the retrieved record includes all fields as
   * defined in the Prisma schema.

   * Validation includes confirming the input UUID formats for both user ID
   * and session ID. Errors due to missing records will result in not found
   * responses, while unauthorized access attempts should be appropriately
   * rejected.
   *
   * Related API operations may include creating new authentication sessions
   * via social login (not exposed here), and deleting sessions to revoke
   * access tokens.

   * authentication session record or an error if not found.

   * tokens and session metadata.
