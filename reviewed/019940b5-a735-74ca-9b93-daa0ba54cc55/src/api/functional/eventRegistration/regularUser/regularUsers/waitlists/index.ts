/**
 * Create a new event waitlist entry for a regular user.
 *
 * Creates a new waitlist entry for a regular user for a specific event. This
 * operation associates the regular user with the event's waitlist in FIFO order
 * based on sign-up time.
 *
 * The endpoint requires the user's ID to ensure authorization and linkage. The
 * request body must specify the event for which the user wants to be
 * waitlisted.
 *
 * Security considerations include verifying that only the authenticated regular
 * user can create their own waitlist entries. Attempting to add duplicate
 * waitlist entries for the same event should fail due to unique constraints.
 *
 * This operation directly corresponds to the event_registration_event_waitlists
 * table, which holds all waitlist entries with timestamps governing the FIFO
 * logic.
 *
 * If the event capacity is full, the user is successfully added to the
 * waitlist. If not full, the API usage for waitlist creation would generally be
 * avoided by client-side logic favoring direct event attendance registration.
 *
 * Errors include validation failures for missing or invalid fields, and
 * authorization errors if the user ID does not match the authenticated user.
