# Event Registration Platform - Requirement Analysis Report

## 1. Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the business requirements for the Event Registration platform. It captures the essential workflows, user roles, and features necessary to build a robust platform that allows users to register, browse, and sign up for events, while enabling organizers and admins to manage events and monitor analytics.

## 2. Business Model

### Why This Service Exists
The Event Registration platform exists to provide an efficient, scalable, and reliable solution for managing events and attendees. It fills a market gap where event organizers need an easy-to-use digital tool to create and promote events, manage attendance, and optimize event capacity based on real user demands. Unlike generic event platforms, this system introduces dynamic capacity adjustments and waitlist automation to enhance user satisfaction and event success rates.

### Revenue Strategy
Revenue can be generated from a tiered subscription model targeting event organizers, offering different levels of features including advanced analytics and capacity management. Additional revenue may come from transactional fees on paid events or through sponsored listings.

### Growth Plan
User acquisition will be driven by targeted marketing and partnerships with event organizers. The platform incentivizes users to verify emails and engage through seamless signup processes and notification logs. Growth also leverages organizer features and analytics attractiveness.

### Success Metrics
Key performance indicators include monthly active users, number of registered events, successful attendee sign-ups, waitlist management efficiency, and user retention rates.

## 3. User Roles and Permissions

### Roles
1. **Regular Users**
   - Can register with email/password.
   - Must verify email before signing up for events.
   - Can browse and sign up for events.
   - Can request event organizer status.

2. **Event Organizers**
   - Can create, update, cancel, and manage their own events.
   - Can view attendee lists and waitlists.
   - Access analytics for their own events.
   - Organizer status requires admin approval.

3. **Administrators**
   - Have global privileges to manage users and events.
   - Can approve organizer requests.
   - Override dynamic capacity adjustments.
   - Perform manual email verifications.
   - View global analytics.

### Authentication and Authorization
- Users must authenticate via email and password.
- Email verification must be completed before event signups.
- Role-based access control restricts features strictly by role.

## 4. Core Functional Requirements

### 4.1 User Registration and Authentication
- WHEN a user registers with email and password, THE system SHALL create an unverified user account with email_verified set to false.
- THE system SHALL store additional user profile information: full name, phone number, and profile picture URL.
- WHEN a user requests organizer status, THE system SHALL record the request for admin approval.
- WHEN a user logs in, THE system SHALL verify credentials and role permissions.

### 4.2 Email Verification Process
- THE system SHALL generate unique email verification tokens associated with user accounts.
- WHEN the user accesses /verify-email/{token} endpoint, THE system SHALL set email_verified to true if the token is valid.
- Admins can manually verify user emails through an admin interface.
- WHERE email_verified is false, THE system SHALL prevent event sign-up for that user.

### 4.3 Event Creation and Management
- Event organizers SHALL be able to create events with the following details: name, date (ISO 8601 format), location, capacity (positive integer), description, ticket price (>= 0), event categories (one or more from: workshop, seminar, social, networking), and event status (scheduled, cancelled, completed).
- WHEN an organizer updates an event, changes SHALL be logged and relevant notifications generated.
- The system SHALL allow organizers to cancel or mark events as complete.
- Admins SHALL have override permissions to manage any event.

### 4.4 Event Browsing and Sign-up
- All users can browse the list of events filtered by categories and status.
- WHEN a verified user attempts to sign up for an event, THE system SHALL check event capacity.
- IF capacity is available, THE system SHALL register the user as an attendee.
- IF capacity is full, THE system SHALL add the user to the event's waitlist.

### 4.5 Waitlist Management and Dynamic Capacity Adjustment
- THE system SHALL maintain a FIFO waitlist for full events.
- WHEN event waitlist size reaches or exceeds 50% of capacity, THE system SHALL increase capacity by 10% automatically.
- WHEN event waitlist size drops below 10% of capacity, THE system SHALL decrease capacity by 10% automatically.
- Admins SHALL be able to override automatic capacity adjustments manually.
- WHEN a registered user cancels their sign-up, THE system SHALL automatically promote the top waitlisted user to registered attendee.
- THE system SHALL log a notification upon waitlist promotion.

### 4.6 Notification Logging
- THE system SHALL log notifications for:
  - Registration confirmations
  - Waitlist promotions
  - Event schedule changes
  - Capacity adjustments
- Users and organizers SHALL be able to view their notification history in their profile dashboard.
- Notifications SHALL be stored with timestamp and type.

### 4.7 Analytics and Reporting
- THE system SHALL track analytics including:
  - Total sign-ups per event
  - Peak registration times
  - Waitlist length trends
  - Event popularity by category
- Organizers SHALL access analytics only for their own events.
- Admins SHALL access global analytics across all events.

## 5. Business Rules and Validation

- Email addresses MUST be unique per user.
- Passwords SHOULD meet complexity requirements as per security guidelines.
- Event dates MUST be future dates at time of creation.
- Capacity MUST be a positive integer.
- Ticket prices MUST be currency valid values, zero or positive.
- Event status values MUST be one of: scheduled, cancelled, completed.
- Users can only request organizer status once every 30 days.
- Waitlist promotions SHALL be strictly FIFO.
- Notifications MUST be logged to immutable storage.

## 6. Error Handling and Recovery

- IF user registration fails due to duplicate email, THEN THE system SHALL return an error indicating the email is already in use.
- IF email verification token is invalid or expired, THEN THE system SHALL reject verification with appropriate error.
- IF users attempt event sign-up without verified email, THEN THE system SHALL block the signup and notify the user.
- IF event capacity cannot be adjusted dynamically due to manual override, THEN THE system SHALL notify admins.
- IN any unexpected system failure, user operations SHALL fail gracefully with clear error messages.

## 7. Performance Requirements

- THE system SHALL process user login and registration requests within 2 seconds.
- Event browsing SHALL respond within 1 second for typical query loads.
- Event sign-up and waitlist operations SHALL complete within 2 seconds.
- Analytics data SHALL be updated near real-time with maximum 5-minute latency.

## 8. Summary
This requirement analysis document outlines the full scope of business needs necessary to build a comprehensive Event Registration platform. It sets clear directives for user roles, event management, sign-up workflows, and advanced features like dynamic capacity adjustment and analytics. The detailed business rules, error scenarios, and performance expectations ensure backend developers will have complete guidance to create a robust, scalable, and user-centric system.
