/**
 * Validate department head nurse detail access control and data correctness.
 *
 * This test covers access control and correctness of nurse detail retrieval via
 * department head context:
 *
 * 1. Register department head A and create a nurse within A's department.
 * 2. Retrieve this nurse profile as department head A to confirm information
 *    matches creation input.
 * 3. Register department head B (distinct department) and create a nurse under B's
 *    department.
 * 4. As department head A, attempt to access B's nurse profile (should fail;
 *    permission enforced).
 * 5. Try to access a non-existent nurseId (random UUID); expect not-found error.
 *
 * The test ensures proper enforcement of department scopeâ€”nurse details are
 * only visible to their head. Each step validates both business logic
 * (ownership and error paths) and data correctness (profile fields).
