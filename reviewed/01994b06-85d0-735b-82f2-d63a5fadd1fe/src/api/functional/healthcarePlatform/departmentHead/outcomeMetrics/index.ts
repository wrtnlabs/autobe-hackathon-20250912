 *
 * Retrieve a paginated and filtered list of outcome metrics defined in the
 * healthcare_platform_outcome_metrics table. This endpoint is foundational for
 * analytics dashboards, organizational performance reviews, and compliance
 * trend analysis. The incoming request supports complex filters, such as
 * organizationId, departmentId, metricName (supports partial/text search),
 * observed_at date range, value threshold filtering, and cohort-based
 * inclusion/exclusion (using cohortDefinition fields). Sorting can be performed
 * on metricName, observed_at, and observedValue.
 *
 * Role-based data access is strictly enforced according to user role, limiting
 * the scope of returned metrics as appropriate (e.g., departmentHead sees only
 * department metrics; organizationAdmin sees all their organization's metrics;
 * systemAdmin sees all). All read access is logged for audit.
 *
 * Pagination and performance must accommodate trends analysis over long time
 * windows. Error handling should address invalid filter criteria, permission
 * violations, or inconsistent search parameters. This operation directly
 * supports quality improvement, regulatory reporting, and benchmarking.
