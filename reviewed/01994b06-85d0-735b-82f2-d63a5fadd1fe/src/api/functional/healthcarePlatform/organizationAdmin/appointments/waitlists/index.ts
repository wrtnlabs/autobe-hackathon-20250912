/**
 * Erase a patient waitlist entry from a specific appointment (hard delete,
 * Scheduling).
 *
 * This API operation is used to delete (hard erase) a patient's waitlist entry
 * from a specific appointment's waitlist in the healthcarePlatform system.
 *
 * It is primarily intended for administrative staff, receptionists, or system
 * automations where a patient no longer needs to remain on the waitlist (e.g.,
 * patient schedules elsewhere, is promoted, or cancels their interest). The
 * operation ensures compliance by fully removing the waitlist record from the
 * healthcare_platform_appointment_waitlists table, which does not feature a
 * soft delete marker—deletion is permanent and cannot be recovered.
 *
 * Security considerations: Only authorized staff or automation with sufficient
 * privileges may perform this operation. The action is auditable and would
 * typically be recorded in the platform’s audit log under appointment
 * management workflows.
 *
 * Validation/business rules: Attempting to erase a non-existent or
 * already-deleted waitlistId yields a suitable error response. Erasures
 * associated with active appointments (still scheduled) are permitted; removing
 * waitlist entries for past/canceled appointments may have further policy or
 * audit consequences as per organizational configuration.
 *
 * Related operations: Staff may query all waitlist entries for an appointment
 * before erasing or remove multiple via separate API calls. This operation only
 * affects the targeted waitlist record for a given appointment.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.appointmentId Unique identifier of the target appointment for
 *   which the waitlist entry should be removed.
 * @param props.waitlistId Unique identifier of the patient's waitlist entry to
