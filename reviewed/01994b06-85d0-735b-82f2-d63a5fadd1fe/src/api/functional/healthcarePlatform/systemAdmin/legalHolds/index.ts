/**
 * Create a new legal hold entry for regulatory, investigatory, or litigation
 * events (healthcare_platform_legal_holds).
 *
 * Creates a new legal hold entry. Healthcare organizations use legal holds when
 * a regulatory, investigatory, or legal event (such as a subpoena, litigation,
 * or compliance audit) requires freezing data. This operation captures all
 * necessary metadata: organization, imposed by, scope type (e.g., patient, org,
 * audit trail), subject entity (if any), business justification for the hold,
 * method (system/manual/legal), current status, effective and expected release
 * dates, and triggers audit and review processes.
 *
 * Compliance implications: Legal holds ensure organizations do not
 * inadvertently delete or modify information subject to legal or regulatory
 * investigation. The operation checks role permissions to ensure only
 * authorized users (admins, compliance personnel) invoke this action. It must
 * capture sufficient context (organization, subject, method, reason, imposed
 * by, status) for full auditability and review.
 *
 * Links to other APIs: The hold can later be updated (PUT), revoked/deleted
 * (DELETE), or have reviews registered via complianceReview APIs. Attempted
 * access to held resources by ordinary users after a hold is created will be
 * denied and logged for auditing. Affected users will be notified by the system
 * via notification APIs.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.body Details for the new legal hold, including organization id,
 *   affected subject(s), type, reason, imposed by, method, expected scope, and
 *   effective/release dates.

/**
 * Archive or erase a legal hold entry (soft delete for audit purposes)

 *
 * Deactivates or archives a legal hold in the system. This action restricts any

 * record for compliance requirements. Actual data removal (hard delete) is only
 * done if permitted by organizational/legal policy; otherwise, the deleted_at
 * field is set for soft deletion (retention in history).
 *
 * Security and compliance: Only systemAdmin or organizationAdmin users may
 * erase legal holds, and the action is always logged with actor, reason, and
 * affected data. The API does not allow deletion of a hold if there are ongoing
 * dependent reviews/investigations unless an explicit override is present.
 * Attempting to erase a non-existent or locked hold results in a permission
 * error. Usage is highly restricted to avoid accidental loss of compliance
 * data.
 *
 * Business process: After erasure, downstream systems are notified to release
 * data locks and update audit records. Compliance staff may be notified as part
 * of the process.
