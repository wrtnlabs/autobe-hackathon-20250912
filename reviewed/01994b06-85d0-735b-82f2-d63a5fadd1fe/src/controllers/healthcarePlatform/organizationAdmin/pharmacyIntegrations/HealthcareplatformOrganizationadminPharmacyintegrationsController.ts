   * pharmacy network or e-prescribing integration for the organization. The
   * request body must include all required configuration properties, such as
   * the pharmacy vendor code, connection URI, protocol, and operational
   * status.
   *
   * This API is typically called by an organizationAdmin or a systemAdmin when
   * onboarding a new pharmacy network (such as Surescripts or NCPDP) or
   * configuring access to a custom or partner pharmacy provider for
   * prescription workflows.
   *
   * The system validates input for uniqueness per organization and
   * pharmacy_vendor_code, prevents duplicate active connectors, and ensures
   * field constraints such as connection URI format and allowed protocol types
   * are met. Any audit or compliance triggers (such as change tracking for
   * regulated connections) are enforced in provider logic.
   *
   * Error responses include validation failure (400), duplication (409), and
   * insufficient permission (403). Newly created integrations are available for
   * immediate use, but full connectivity status may be pending external
   * validation or credentialing steps. Sensitive credentials are not directly
   * stored in this table, only connection metadata and mapping. All actions are
   * audit-logged for security and compliance traceability.
