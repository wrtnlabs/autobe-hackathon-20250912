   * Each audit log entry contains references to the affected entity (invoice,

   * in the system.
   *
   * Authorization is strictly enforced: only users with appropriate roles
   * (systemAdmin or organizationAdmin) may access audit details, and all access
   * is logged for further review purposes. The returned data structure mirrors
