   * Search and paginate patient records with advanced filters

   *
   * This operation retrieves a paginated, filtered list of patient records
   * housed within the healthcarePlatform system. It is designed for use by
   * authorized roles such as clinicians, administrative staff, and compliance
   * officers who require efficient access to longitudinal patient data across
   * organizational and departmental boundaries.
   *
   * The endpoint supports advanced search criteria, including but not limited
   * to partial name matches, date-of-birth ranges, demographic fields (handled
   * as JSON), status queries (active, inactive, deceased, transferred), and
   * optional filtering by department or organization. Sorting and pagination
   * parameters are implemented to support scalable, real-time data entry and
   * clinical review workflows.
   *
   * All search requests are logged with user and organization context for
   * compliance and auditability, ensuring that access to PHI aligns with
   * organizational policies. Privacy flags and consent controls are enforced,
   * and unauthorized users are denied access with appropriate error messaging.
   * Any inclusion of soft-deleted or archived records requires explicit
   * compliance override, and these cases are fully auditable.
   *
   * Related operations include detailed patient record retrieval (GET
   * /patientRecords/{id}), patient creation, and clinical encounter listing.
   * Error handling includes detailed feedback on failed queries, invalid
   * filters, or permission denials, following the organization's regulatory
   * requirements.

   * @param body Search criteria, filter, and pagination controls for advanced
   *   patient record queries.

   *
   * This endpoint allows retrieval of a detailed patient record profile by
   * patientRecordId, as defined in the 'healthcare_platform_patient_records'
   * table. The operation returns all main columns: organization and department
   * assignment, patient user reference, external patient number if set, legal
   * full name, date of birth, gender, record status, extensible demographics
   * JSON, timestamps for creation and update, and the current soft delete
   * status.

   * presence of protected health information (PHI). Only authenticated and
   * authorized roles, such as clinical staff (doctor, nurse), department heads,
   * and admins, can invoke this endpoint with all access logged for HIPAA
   * compliance.
   *
   * Business logic includes: 1) Ensuring that only users within the same
   * organization or with explicit delegated rights can access the record; 2)
   * Checking the 'deleted_at' soft delete flagâ€”records with this set are
   * excluded unless under audit special circumstances; 3) Supporting regulatory
   * workflows, audit requirements, and patient self-access consent rules as
   * described in business specifications. Errors are handled by returning not
   * found for non-existent or ineligible records, and special messaging when
   * access is denied due to consent or assignment boundaries.
