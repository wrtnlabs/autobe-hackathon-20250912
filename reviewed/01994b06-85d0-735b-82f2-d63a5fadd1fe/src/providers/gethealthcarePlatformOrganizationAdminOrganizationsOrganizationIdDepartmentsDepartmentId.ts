/**
 * Gets detailed information for a single department (departmentId) in a

 * name, and status. Ensures RBAC: only accessible by organization admins and
 * only if department belongs to their managed organization. Soft-deleted
 * departments are not returned for standard organizationadmin.
 *
 * @param props - Input arguments for department detail fetch.
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - Authenticated payload for organization admin
 *   (must match RBAC)
 * @param props.organizationId - UUID of the organization (parent)
 * @param props.departmentId - Department UUID to fetch
 * @returns Department details matching IHealthcarePlatformDepartment
 * @throws {Error} If not found or not part of organization, or soft-deleted
