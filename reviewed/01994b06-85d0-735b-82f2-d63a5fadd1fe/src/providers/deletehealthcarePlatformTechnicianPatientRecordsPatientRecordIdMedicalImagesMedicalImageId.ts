/**
 * Permanently delete a medical image for a patient (hard delete â€“
 * healthcare_platform_medical_images).
 *
 * This operation removes a specific medical image and its metadata from the
 * system. It enforces hard deletion, as the healthcare_platform_medical_images
 * table has no soft-delete field. Only the technician who originally uploaded
 * the image may perform this operation. Deletion is prohibited if the parent
 * patient record is under active legal or compliance hold (determined by the
 * presence of a healthcare_platform_record_locks row where released_at is
 * null). Unauthorized or ineligible attempts are rejected. Audit logging of the
 * deletion should be implemented externally by the caller or downstream.
 *
 * @param props - Request properties
 * @param props.technician - The authenticated technician requesting the
 *   deletion (role enforced)
 * @param props.patientRecordId - UUID of the patient record to which the image
 *   belongs
 * @param props.medicalImageId - UUID of the medical image to delete
 * @returns Void (no response body for 204 success)
 * @throws {Error} 404 if image not found or does not belong to the patient
 *   record
 * @throws {Error} 403 if user is not authorized (not uploading technician) or
 *   if patient record is under hold
