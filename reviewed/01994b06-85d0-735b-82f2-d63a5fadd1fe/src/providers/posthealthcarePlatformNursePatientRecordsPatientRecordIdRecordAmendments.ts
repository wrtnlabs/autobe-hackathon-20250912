/**
 * Create a new record amendment for a patient record
 *
 * This operation allows an authenticated nurse (clinical staff) to initiate a
 * new record amendment (correction, update, regulatory-driven change, etc.) for
 * a patient record in compliance with platform policy. Only nurses with
 * appropriate scope may perform this action for a given record.
 *
 * The nurse's action is validated for business/rbac context (existence, not
 * deleted, and record is in active state). Full audit trace is maintained.
 * Request must provide amendment type, rationale, before/after values, and may
 * optionally include reviewer and encounter context per workflow/business
 * process. If business/org/department context links are required for further
 * RBAC enforcement, those must be extended at schema/relationship level. All
 * operations are safe, type-checked, and compliant with null/optional field
 * rules.
 *
 * @param props - Props containing authenticated nurse (NursePayload),
 *   patientRecordId, and amendment creation body
 * @param props.nurse - The authenticated nurse user (must exist, is submitter)
 * @param props.patientRecordId - UUID of the patient record to amend
 * @param props.body - Amendment creation data, including all business fields
 * @returns The newly created amendment (full audit details, workflow status)
 * @throws {Error} 404 if patient record does not exist or is soft deleted
 * @throws {Error} 403 if nurse is not allowed to amend this record (future
 *   RBAC)
