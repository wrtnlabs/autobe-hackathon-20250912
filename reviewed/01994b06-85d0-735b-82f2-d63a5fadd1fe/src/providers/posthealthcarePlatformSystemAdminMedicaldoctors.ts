/**
 * Create a new medical doctor record (healthcare_platform_medicaldoctors).
 *
 * Creates a new medical doctor profile and adds them to the healthcare
 * platform. Consumers must supply all mandatory fields as defined by the
 * healthcare_platform_medicaldoctors table, such as email, full name, NPI
 * number, and other professional details. On successful creation, the provider
 * record will be accessible for further assignment to departments, clinical
 * scheduling, or license validation.
 *
 * Only authorized users (system admins or organization admins) can execute this
 * operation. The input request is validated for uniqueness constraints (email,
 * NPI number) and field formats. Business logic may trigger credential
 * verification and onboarding workflows as part of post-processing.
 *
 * Related API operations include updating a doctor's profile, assigning
 * provider to organizations/departments, or starting credential validation
 * sequences. All creation actions are fully audited.
 *
 * @param props - Object containing system admin payload and new doctor body
 * @param props.systemAdmin - SystemadminPayload (authenticated system admin)
 * @param props.body - IHealthcarePlatformMedicalDoctor.ICreate (doctor creation
 *   fields)
 * @returns Newly created IHealthcarePlatformMedicalDoctor record (with id,
 *   metadata, and created/updated timestamps)
 * @throws {Error} When doctor with same email or npi_number already exists
