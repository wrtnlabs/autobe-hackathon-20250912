/**
 * Create a new clinical decision support rule (CDS) in the platform.
 *
 * This operation creates a new CDS rule row in the
 * 'healthcare_platform_decision_support_rules' table, storing all required
 * configuration and business data coupled to the authenticated admin's
 * organization. Only privileged organizationAdmin users may perform this
 * operation, and scope is strictly enforcedâ€”created CDS rules must match the
 * admin's own organization. Uniqueness of rule_code within the organization is
 * enforced for compliance and business logic integrity. All timestamps and
 * identifiers are handled safely with branded types.
 *
 * @param props - Properties for the request, including organizationAdmin
 *   authentication payload and CDS rule creation body.
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - Authenticated organizationAdmin
 * @param props.body - IHealthcarePlatformDecisionSupportRule.ICreate, providing
 *   configuration, logic, and metadata for the new rule.
 * @returns The created CDS rule as an IHealthcarePlatformDecisionSupportRule,
 *   with system-assigned ID and generated timestamps.
 * @throws {Error} If the rule_code already exists for the organization or if
 *   organization scope is violated.
