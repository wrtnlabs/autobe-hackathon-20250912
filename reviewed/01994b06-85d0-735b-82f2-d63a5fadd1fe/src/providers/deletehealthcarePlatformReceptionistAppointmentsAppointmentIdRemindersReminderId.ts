/**
 * Soft-delete (mark as deleted) an appointment reminder by receptionist.
 *
 * This operation cannot be fully implemented as described because the Prisma
 * schema for `healthcare_platform_appointment_reminders` lacks a `deleted_at`
 * field required for marking reminders as soft-deleted. As a fallback, this
 * implementation returns void using typia.random<void>().
 *
 * Resolution options:
 *
 * 1. Update the Prisma schema to add a `deleted_at` field supporting soft delete.
 * 2. Change this endpoint to perform a hard delete until schema is updated.
 *
 * @param props - See API specification for required parameters.
 * @returns Void (type-safe placeholder)
 * @throws {Error} If reminder does not exist or is already deleted (would
 *   require schema update to check).
 * @todo Update schema or endpoint logic to enable true soft delete.
