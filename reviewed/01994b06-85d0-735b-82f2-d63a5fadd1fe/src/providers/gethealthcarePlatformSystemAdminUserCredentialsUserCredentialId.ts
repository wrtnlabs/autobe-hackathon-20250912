/**
 * Retrieve details of an archived user credential entry by its ID from the

 * responses.
 *
 * This operation enables strict, role-restricted access to the full details of
 * an archived user credential for authorized system administrators, supporting
 * audit/compliance workflows. The credential_hash field is always masked for
 * securityâ€”never returned raw. If the specified credential does not exist, an
 * error is thrown. All access is assumed to be properly logged at the
 * controller/decorator level; unauthorized access is prevented higher in the
 * stack.
 *
 * @param props - SystemAdmin: Authenticated SystemadminPayload (must have valid

 *   retrieve
 * @returns Archived user credential record, with credential_hash always
 *   redacted as '********'
 * @throws {Error} Throws if credential not found or unauthorized (handled by
