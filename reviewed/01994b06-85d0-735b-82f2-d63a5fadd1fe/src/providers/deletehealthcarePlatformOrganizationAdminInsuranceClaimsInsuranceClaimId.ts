/**
 * Soft-delete (mark deleted) an insurance claim by insuranceClaimId, with full
 * audit compliance.
 *
 * This operation marks the given insurance claim (by insuranceClaimId) as
 * deleted by setting the deleted_at timestamp. Claim deletion is strictly
 * allowed only for claims that are not in a paid or finalized status (e.g., not
 * paid/finalized/settled). Only the rightful organization admin may perform
 * this action, and the operation is fully logged for compliance audit. Physical
 * deletion is never performed; all deletes are soft.
 *
 * @param props - The operation parameters
 * @param props.organizationAdmin - The authenticated organization admin user
 *   performing this operation
 * @param props.insuranceClaimId - The unique insurance claim id to delete
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the claim does not exist, does not belong to the current
 *   org admin's organization, is already deleted, or has status
 *   (paid/finalized/settled) that cannot be deleted per business/compliance
 *   policy.
