/**
 * Delete a specific notification by its ID (healthcare_platform_notifications
 * table)
 *
 * This operation permanently deletes a notification record from the healthcare
 * platform, identified by its unique notificationId. System administrators only
 * may invoke this function. The deletion is a hard deleteâ€”no data will remain,
 * and the record is unrecoverable.
 *
 * Security:
 *
 * - Only authenticated system administrators (props.systemAdmin) may delete
 *   notifications.
 * - Attempting to delete notifications not found by their ID results in a 404 Not
 *   Found error.
 * - This operation should be logged for audit, but core provider does not handle
 *   logging directly.
 *
 * @param props - The operation parameters:
 *
 *   - SystemAdmin: The authenticated SystemadminPayload performing the deletion
 *       (must have type 'systemAdmin')
 *   - NotificationId: The unique identifier of the notification to delete
 *
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If props.systemAdmin is missing/wrong type (Unauthorized)
 * @throws {Error} If the notification to delete does not exist (404 Not Found)
