   * Create a new guest user for registration.
   *
   * This operation registers a new guest user within the system. Guests are
   * unauthenticated users who intend to sign up. The Guest entity records
   * minimal information such as email and timestamps. This API endpoint accepts
   * a JSON payload with at least the guest email. Upon successful creation, it
   * returns the guest record including the generated UUID and audit
   * timestamps.
   *
   * Security considerations note that this endpoint is public and does not
   * require authentication as guests are unauthenticated users by design.
   *
   * The operation directly manipulates the subscription_renewal_guardian_guest
   * table in the database. Validation ensures the email format is correct, and
   * uniqueness constraints at the business logic level are assumed.
   *
   * Clients use this endpoint to initiate the signup process by creating a
   * guest record which can later be converted or associated with a full user
   * account.
   *
   * Errors will be returned if required fields are missing or input formats are
   * invalid. Appropriate HTTP codes and error messages will be used to convey
   * validation failures.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Guest user creation payload containing email address
