   * Retrieve a specific vendor's detailed information.

   * Retrieve details of a specific vendor by vendorId from the Vendors table.
   * This operation fetches all information stored about the vendor, including
   * name, creation date, update date, and if applicable, soft deletion
   * timestamp.
   *
   * Security and Permissions: Only authenticated users with user role may
   * access this data for their vendors. Admin roles with read permissions also
   * allowed.
   *
   * The vendor is uniquely identified by a UUID, which is passed as a path
   * parameter vendorId. The response body returns a detailed vendor object with
   * relevant fields.
   *
   * Validation includes ensuring vendorId is a valid UUID string corresponding
   * to an existing vendor record. Error responses will be provided if vendor
   * not found or unauthorized access.
   *
   * Related Operations: Vendors create, update, and delete operations
   * complement this read operation.
   *
   * Expected behavior: On success, returns vendor detailed info. On failure,
   * returns 404 or 403 errors.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param vendorId Unique identifier of the target vendor
