- `description`
  > Detailed description explaining the role's responsibilities and
  > permissions.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when the role record was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when the role record was last updated.

### `task_management_task_statuses`

tasks, such as low, medium, or high. These settings influence task
sorting and alerting mechanisms within the system.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `code`: Unique code representing priority level, e.g., 'low', 'medium', 'high'.
- `name`: Human-friendly priority name, e.g., 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'.
