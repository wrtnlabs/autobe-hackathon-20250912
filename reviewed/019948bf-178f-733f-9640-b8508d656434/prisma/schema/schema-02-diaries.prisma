/// This table stores each mood diary entry, representing the core journaling
/// activity in the Mood Diary application. Each entry records a mood
/// selected from a fixed set of 8 types, an optional note (up to 500 Unicode
/// characters), an automatic creation timestamp, and an "archived" status
/// indicating if the entry is older than 30 days (and therefore excluded
/// from listings and summaries). Entries are immutable: once created, they
/// cannot be edited or deleted. Each entry references the logical diary user
/// in the system ({@link mood_diary_diaryusers}), supporting future
/// extensibility for multi-user scenarios. All mood and archiving business
/// rules are strictly enforced in application logic.
