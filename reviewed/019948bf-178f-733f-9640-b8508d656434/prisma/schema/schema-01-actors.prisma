/// Represents the logical owner/actor of the Mood Diary. This model

/// via foreign keys and ensures the actor boundary is clear. By
/// encapsulating user context here, future expansion to a multi-user
/// scenario or advanced metadata storage is simplified. Fields are minimized
/// as only a logical system user is required.
