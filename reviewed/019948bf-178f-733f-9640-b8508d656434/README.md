## 1. User Message

> Create a simple Mood Diary application where users can log their daily moods (happy, sad, anxious, excited, etc.) with personal notes and timestamps. The app should allow users to view all their mood entries and generate weekly summaries showing how often they experienced each mood type.
> 
> Include these features:
> - Users can add up to 3 mood entries per day
> - Reject entries with future timestamps  
> - Archive entries older than 30 days (exclude from summaries)
> - Generate weekly mood statistics
> - No user authentication required
> - Keep the app simple and user-friendly

## 2. Assistant Message

> Thank you for describing your requirements for the Mood Diary application. Here’s a summary to confirm your needs and check for any missing details before moving to the next planning step:
> 
> ## Mood Diary App – Requirements Summary
> 
> **Purpose:**  
> Allow users to log their daily moods (e.g., happy, sad, anxious, excited, etc.) with personal notes and timestamps, and view helpful mood statistics.
> 
> ### Core Features
> 
> 1. **Mood Logging**
>     - Users can add a new mood entry (mood type + note + timestamp)
>     - Maximum 3 entries per day per user
>     - Reject entries with timestamps set in the future
> 
> 2. **Viewing Entries**
>     - Users can see a list of all their mood entries
> 
> 3. **Archiving**
>     - Automatically archive entries older than 30 days (these will not appear in statistics or recent lists)
> 
> 4. **Weekly Statistics**
>     - App generates a simple summary for the past week (e.g., chart/table showing how often each mood was logged)
>     - Only entries from the past 7 days are considered in the summary
> 
> 5. **User Simplicity**
>     - No user authentication (all entries are under a single user, i.e., app-wide log, or per-device)
>     - User interface and API (if exposed) should be easy to use
> 
> ### Please Confirm or Clarify
> 
> - Does each mood entry only have: mood type (choose from a few options), optional note, and timestamp?
> - What are the mood types? (e.g., happy, sad, anxious, excited — do you want to specify a fixed list, or should this be flexible?)
> - Should users be able to edit or delete old entries?
> - Is it acceptable that all data is stored without authentication, meaning anyone using the app can see/edit all mood entries?
> - May I assume the app runs online (web/mobile), or will this be used offline/local only? (Determines if you’d need multi-user support in future)
> - Would you like to see each archived entry anywhere (e.g., in a history list), or are they just hidden from all views and stats after 30 days?
> 
> Once you confirm or clarify the above, I can proceed to formalize the detailed specifications and start generating the backend plan.

## 3. User Message

> Mood Entry Structure: Each mood entry should contain: mood type (from predefined list), optional note (text), and automatic timestamp when created. Mood Types: Use a fixed list of common moods: happy, sad, anxious, excited, angry, calm, stressed, tired. Keep it simple with 8 standard options. Edit/Delete Functionality: No editing or deleting of entries allowed. This keeps data integrity simple and prevents complex validation logic. Authentication/Privacy: No authentication required. Treat it as a single-user app where all entries belong to one user. This is acceptable for the testing scope. Online vs Offline: Design it as a web application that runs online. No need for offline functionality or multi-user support. Archived Entries: Archived entries (older than 30 days) should be completely hidden from all views and not accessible through any interface. They exist only for potential future data export.
