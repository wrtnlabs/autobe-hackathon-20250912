   * Update an enrollment by ID.

   * Update an existing enrollment by ID in the Enterprise LMS system. This
   * operation allows modification of enrollment fields such as the enrollment
   * status, business status, and timestamps under tenant control.
   *
   * Updates are validated against business rules ensuring that only active
   * enrollments are modified and proper statuses are used. This operation is
   * key for managing learner progression in training programs including
   * enrollment cancellations or completions.
   *
   * Tenant isolation is strictly enforced: only enrollments belonging to the
   * authorized tenant context can be updated.
   *
   * The underlying database table is enterprise_lms_enrollments, which stores
   * learner enrollment information linking learners to learning paths. The
   * update input must comply with the IEnterpriseLmsEnrollment.IUpdate
   * interface.
   *
   * Authorization roles are systemAdmin, organizationAdmin, and
   * departmentManager with sufficient permissions to update enrollment data.
   *
   * No response body is returned as the operation confirms update via HTTP
   * status codes.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param id Unique identifier of the enrollment to update
