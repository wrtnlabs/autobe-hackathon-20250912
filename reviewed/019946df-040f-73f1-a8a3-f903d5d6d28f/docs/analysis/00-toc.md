# Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) Detailed Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Business Model

The Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) is designed to serve multiple organizations with isolated data and configuration settings. It addresses the need for scalable, AI-powered training platforms that support complex organizational hierarchies, compliance tracking, personalized learning paths, and advanced analytics. The systemâ€™s revenue model combines organizational subscriptions, paid certifications and courses for external learners, and premium integration services. Success is measured by active user engagement, course completion rates, and regulatory compliance.

### 1.2 User Roles and Permission Overview

The LMS includes a comprehensive role hierarchy to enforce granular access control across organizations:
- System Administrator
- Organization Administrator
- Department Manager
- Content Creator / Instructor
- Corporate Learner
- External Learner
- Guest

Roles are customizable within security constraints through a dynamic permissions matrix managed by Organization Administrators.

## 2. Multi-Tenant Architecture

### 2.1 Tenant Data Isolation

The system SHALL implement a shared database schema tagging all data with a unique tenant_id to ensure logical data segregation at all layers, preventing data leakage between organizations.

### 2.2 Tenant-Specific Branding and Customization

Each tenant SHALL customize branding elements including logos, color palettes, and apply white-label CSS overrides. Custom domain support is provided. Branding configurations SHALL be stored securely in tenant settings.

## 3. User Management and Authentication

### 3.1 Authentication Workflow

User authentication SHALL support conventional email/password login, password resets, email verification, and session management with expiration and revocation capabilities. Single Sign-On SHALL integrate via SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, and LDAP.

### 3.2 Role Hierarchy and Permissions

Roles follow a strict hierarchy with scope-limited attribute and role-based access controls:
- System Administrator: Full access across all organizations
- Organization Administrator: Manage users, content, approvals, and billing within their org
- Department Manager: Manage users and content within their department
- Content Creator/Instructor: Manage own course content and student progress
- Corporate Learner: Enroll and complete courses, access personal analytics
- External Learner: Limited access to public/paid courses, payment processing
- Guest: Browse public content catalog only

### 3.3 Permission Matrix

A dynamic permission matrix allows Organization Administrators to assign granular permissions within system-enforced minimum security levels. Context-aware controls limit actions to owned resources or designated scopes.

## 4. Content Management System

### 4.1 Supported Content Formats

Content formats supported include videos, PDF, DOCX, PPT, SCORM packages, xAPI/Tin Can API, and interactive HTML5 content.

### 4.2 Content Versioning and Approval Process

All content SHALL support unlimited versioning with full rollback. The system retains the latest 5 versions online, archiving older versions securely with retrieval capabilities. Approval workflows are multi-stage and configurable.

### 4.3 Localization and Tagging

The system supports content localization across languages with translation workflows. A hierarchical tagging system SHALL enable fine-grained content search and categorization.

## 5. Learning Path and Curriculum Management

### 5.1 AI-Driven Adaptive Learning Paths

Initial learning recommendations are rule-based leveraging content tags and learner preferences, progressing to AI/ML models that personalize learning paths dynamically.

### 5.2 Prerequisites Enforcement

Courses and modules SHALL enforce prerequisite chains. Learners cannot enroll without satisfying prior requirements, though admins may override with audit.

### 5.3 Certification and Competency Mapping

Certification programs SHALL include expiration and renewal policies. Competency mapping SHALL connect learning content to specific skills and proficiency levels.

### 5.4 Blended Learning Support

Online and offline activities SHALL be combined. Offline progress can be tracked manually or integrated through APIs with attendance and badge systems.

## 6. Assessment and Analytics Engine

### 6.1 Multiple Assessment Types

The system supports quizzes, surveys, peer reviews, practical assignments, and proctored exams via third-party proctoring vendor plugins.

### 6.2 Analytics Dashboard and Reporting

Dashboards present real-time insights into learning progress, engagement, performance trends, and completion metrics.

### 6.3 Predictive Analytics

AI-powered analytics SHALL predict learner success probabilities, competency achievement likelihood, and risk flags for compliance training.

### 6.4 Compliance Reporting

Automated report generation supports regulated industry mandates, with data retention for audits.

## 7. Communication and Collaboration

### 7.1 Discussion Forums and Messaging

Threaded, moderated forums facilitate learner interaction. Direct messaging supports secure file sharing with compliance archiving.

### 7.2 Virtual Classrooms Integration

Platform-agnostic integration supports Zoom, WebEx, Microsoft Teams, and custom virtual classroom solutions with calendar scheduling.

### 7.3 Group Projects and Announcements

Collaborative projects allow resource sharing and submission management. Targeted announcements provide delivery receipts and audit logs.

## 8. Business Rules and Validation

### 8.1 Enrollment and Certification Rules

Enrollment SHALL be disallowed unless prerequisites are met, with overrides auditable by admins. Certificates issued only on successful completion of required assessments.

### 8.2 Content Access Control

Content visibility SHALL be scoped based on tenant, department, and role restrictions.

### 8.3 Progress Tracking

Detailed analytics SHALL track time spent, attempts, and engagement. Data updates SHALL be near real-time or within one minute.

### 8.4 Compliance and Retention Policies

Training and certification records SHALL be retained securely for a minimum of 7 years using tiered storage with full searchability.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

### 9.1 Performance

Support for 10,000+ concurrent users per organization during peaks with API latency under 200 ms for 95% of requests. Adaptive bitrate streaming and resumable file uploads up to 2 GB.

### 9.2 Security

AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, GDPR, CCPA, FERPA compliance, DRM and watermarking of content. SOC2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification.

### 9.3 Scalability

Multi-region deployments, auto-scaling via container orchestration, database sharding, multi-layer caching (Redis, CDN), and asynchronous background processing.

## 10. Integration Requirements

### 10.1 Third-Party Service Integrations

Slack, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Workday, BambooHR integrations for notifications, user sync, and reporting.

### 10.2 Payment and Email Services

Stripe integration for payments and subscriptions. SendGrid/AWS SES for transactional email with retry and logging.

### 10.3 Analytics and BI Integration

Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Tableau, PowerBI with data export APIs and custom dashboards.

## 11. Error Handling and Recovery

Graceful handling of authentication failures, enrollment validation, upload retries, approval rejections, and notification delivery.

## 12. Success Metrics and Monitoring

Meeting performance SLAs, concurrency targets, compliance reporting accuracy, AI recommendation improvements, and system uptime goals.
