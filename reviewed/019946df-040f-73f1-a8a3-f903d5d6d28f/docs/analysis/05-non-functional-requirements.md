# Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) Functional Requirements and Business Logic

## 1. Introduction

The Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) is a multi-tenant platform designed to facilitate comprehensive training programs for multiple organizations. This document provides in-depth functional requirements and business logic to guide backend developers in building a scalable, secure, and feature-rich LMS with AI-powered personalization, advanced analytics, and compliance tracking.

## 2. Business Model Overview

### 2.1 Why This Service Exists
THE LMS SHALL provide a scalable, secure, and customizable platform to address enterprise training needs with complex organizational structures and regulatory compliance. This service fills a market gap by integrating AI-driven learning paths, multi-tenant isolation, and extensive analytics.

### 2.2 Revenue Strategy
THE LMS SHALL generate revenue primarily through organizational subscriptions, paid external certifications, and premium integrations.

### 2.3 Growth and Success Metrics
THE system SHALL track and optimize the number of active organizations, monthly active users, course completion rates, certification renewals, and adherence to compliance standards.

## 3. User Roles and Authentication Requirements

### 3.1 Comprehensive Role Definitions
- System Administrator: Full access to all organizations, server configurations, global analytics, and integration management.
- Organization Administrator: Manages own organizationâ€™s users, content, settings, billing.
- Department Manager: Oversees users and content within their department.
- Content Creator/Instructor: Creates and manages own content and learner progress.
- Corporate Learner: Enrolls in courses, tracks progress, accesses learner dashboard.
- External Learner: Limited access to public courses, payment handling, basic progress tracking.
- Guest: Browse-only access to public course catalogs.

### 3.2 Authentication Flow
WHEN a user attempts login, THE system SHALL support authentication via credentials or enterprise SSO (SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, LDAP) with response times under 2 seconds.

### 3.3 Permissions Management
THE system SHALL enforce both role-based and attribute-based controls, allowing Organization Admins to customize permissions dynamically under minimum security constraints. Instructors SHALL modify only own content; Department Managers SHALL access only own department data.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Multi-Tenant Architecture
- THE system SHALL use a shared database schema with tenant-specific identifiers ensuring strict data isolation.
- THE system SHALL support tenant-specific branding including logos, colors, custom domains, and CSS overrides.

### 4.2 User Management & Authentication
- THE system SHALL maintain audit trails of all user actions.
- Self-registration for external learners SHALL be supported with email verification and optional admin approval.

### 4.3 Content Management
- THE system SHALL support multiple content formats including video, PDFs, PPTs, SCORM, xAPI/Tin Can API, and interactive HTML5.
- SCORM/xAPI packages SHALL be parsed and converted internally while preserving the original.
- Unlimited version tracking with the latest 5 active versions stored online; older versions archived with retrievability.
- Multi-stage configurable content approval workflow.
- Localization and hierarchical tagging system for content.

### 4.4 Learning Path & Curriculum
- THE LMS SHALL deliver AI-driven adaptive learning paths, starting with rule-based recommendations and evolving to machine learning as data grows.
- Prerequisites and complex course dependencies SHALL be enforced.
- Certification tracks with expiration and renewal SHALL be supported.
- Competency mapping of skills and proficiency levels SHALL be enabled.
- Blended learning support including offline activity tracking either manual or API integrated.

### 4.5 Assessment & Analytics Engine
- Support quizzes, surveys, peer reviews, practical assignments, and third-party proctored exams.
- Advanced dashboards for learning progress, engagement, and performance trends.
- AI prediction models SHALL provide learner success likelihood and compliance risk.
- Automated compliance report generation.
- Real-time smart notifications for events and deadlines.

### 4.6 Communication & Collaboration
- Threaded forums with moderation.
- Secure direct messaging with compliance archiving.
- Platform-agnostic live virtual classrooms integrating Zoom, WebEx, Teams, and custom platforms.
- Group projects with collaborative workspace and submission tracking.
- Targeted announcements with delivery confirmation.

## 5. Critical Business Rules and Validation

- Enrollment SHALL be blocked if prerequisites are unmet; admins can override with audit logging.
- Certificates issued only upon passing required assessments.
- Content access restricted by tenant, department, and role.
- Tracking detailed learner progress including attempts, time, and engagement.
- Training records retained at least 7 years in tiered storage allowing instant search.
- Tenant data SHALL be fully isolated preventing cross-organizational access.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- Support 10,000+ concurrent users per tenant during peaks.
- API response times under 200ms for 95% of requests.
- Adaptive bitrate streaming with CDN.
- Resumable file uploads up to 2GB.
- AES-256 encryption at rest; TLS 1.3 in transit.
- GDPR, CCPA, FERPA compliance.
- SOC2 Type II and ISO 27001 certification.
- Horizontal auto-scaling and multi-region deployments.
- Database sharding and multi-layer caching.
- Background jobs processed asynchronously.

## 7. Integration Requirements

- Integrate Slack, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Workday, BambooHR.
- Payment via Stripe supporting B2C and subscription billing.
- Email via SendGrid or AWS SES.
- Cloud storage with AWS S3 or Azure Blob and CDN.
- Analytics integration with Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Tableau, PowerBI.

## 8. Error Handling and Recovery

- Deny enrollments lacking prerequisites with clear notification.
- Authentication failures return HTTP 401 with specific error codes.
- Fail-safe large file upload retries.
- Content approval rejection workflows notify creators with details.
- Integration failures logged and retried with alerts.

## 9. Success Metrics

- 95% API responses below 200ms under load.
- Sustaining 10,000+ concurrent users without degradation.
- Automatic and compliant report generation.
- Improvement in course completion via AI recommendations.
- 99.9% system uptime.
