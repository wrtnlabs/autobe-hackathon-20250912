# Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) Business and Functional Requirements

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Objective
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive, implementation-ready set of business requirements for the Enterprise Learning Management System (LMS) with AI-powered features. These requirements serve as the definitive guide for backend developers to build a scalable, secure, and feature-rich LMS platform serving multiple enterprise organizations.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers functional requirements, business logic, role permissions, authentication, multi-tenancy, content management, curriculum personalization, assessments, communications, integrations, and non-functional demands such as scalability, security, and compliance.

### 1.3 Audience
This document is intended exclusively for backend development teams responsible for implementing the LMS. It assumes familiarity with enterprise SaaS software concepts but does not include implementation specifics like database schemas or API contracts.

## 2. Business Model

### 2.1 Why the Service Exists
Enterprises require centralized systems to manage employee training across complex organizational hierarchies with strict compliance regulations. The service addresses gaps in multi-tenant data isolation, AI-assisted adaptive learning, comprehensive compliance audits, and integrated analytics.

### 2.2 Revenue and Growth Strategy
Revenue streams include organizational subscriptions, paid individual certifications, premium feature add-ons, and transaction fees for B2C course purchases. Growth strategies emphasize enterprise sales, regulatory compliance capabilities, and AI-powered learning enhancements.

### 2.3 Success Metrics
- Monthly active users per tenant
- Course completion and certification rates
- AI recommendation adoption
- Compliance audit success
- System uptime and response metrics

## 3. User Roles and Authentication

### 3.1 Role Hierarchy
- System Administrator: global system control, server management, integration administration
- Organization Administrator: manages users, roles, billing, content approval within their tenant
- Department Manager: manages departmental users and content assignments
- Content Creator/Instructor: creates and manages training content, monitors learner progress
- Corporate Learner: enrolls in courses, tracks learning progress, downloads certificates
- External Learner: limited public access, B2C course payment, community participation
- Guest: browse catalog, no enrollments

### 3.2 Authentication Flows
- Users can register, login, logout, reset passwords, verify emails
- Support SSO via SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, LDAP
- JWT tokens used with claims for userId, role, permissions, tenantId, expiration
- Sessions expire after 30 days inactivity
