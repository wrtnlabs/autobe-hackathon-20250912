## 1. User Message

> Now I'm gonna give my requirements for a project are you ready to build?

## 2. Assistant Message

> Yes, I'm ready to help you build your project! Please provide the details of your requirements. To get started, could you tell me:
> 
> - What is the main purpose or goal of your system?
> - What core features or functions do you want it to have?
> - Who will be the users and what kind of roles or permissions should they have?
> 
> Feel free to describe any details or examples you have in mind. If you’re not sure about technical terms, that's perfectly okay—I can help guide you step by step.

## 3. User Message

> Create a recipe sharing backend where users can:
> - Create recipes with ingredients, steps, and nutritional info
> - Tag recipes with multiple categories (cuisine, diet, difficulty)  
> - Rate and review recipes with detailed feedback
> - Follow other users and see personalized recipe feeds
> - Search recipes by available ingredients with partial matching
> - Track personal recipe collections and weekly meal plans
> 
> Critical challenge: Users can substitute ingredients (e.g., "almond milk" for "dairy milk") and the system should:
> - Automatically adjust nutritional calculations
> - Suggest recipe modifications for dietary restrictions
> - Track ingredient cost variations for budget planning
> - Generate shopping lists with store availability checking

## 4. Assistant Message

> Thank you for the detailed features! To build this recipe sharing backend effectively, let's clarify some important points and gather a bit more info:
> 
> 1. User Roles:
>    - Will there be just general users who can create and interact with recipes?
>    - Any admin roles or moderators needed?
> 
> 2. Recipe Details:
>    - For nutritional info, what specific data do you want tracked? (e.g., calories, macros, vitamins)
>    - How detailed should the ingredients be? (e.g., quantities, units, brands)
> 
> 3. Tags & Categories:
>    - Could you list the exact categories for tagging (cuisine types, diet types like vegan, keto, difficulty levels, etc.)?
>    - Will the categories be pre-defined or user-generated?
> 
> 4. Rating & Reviews:
>    - What rating scale do you want? (e.g., 1 to 5 stars)
>    - Any moderation or reporting of reviews?
> 
> 5. Following & Feed:
>    - How should the personalized feed be prioritized? (e.g., most recent recipes from followed users, highest rated first)
>    
> 6. Searching by ingredients:
>    - Should the search match all listed ingredients, or any subset?
>    - Is partial word matching enough? (e.g., "almond" finds "almond milk")
> 
> 7. Personal Collections & Meal Plans:
>    - How would users add recipes to collections or meal plans? (e.g., drag and drop, select from lists)
>    - Any calendar integration needed for meal plans?
> 
> 8. Ingredient Substitutions & Nutritional Adjustments:
>    - How many substitute options per ingredient do you expect?
>    - Will user preferences or dietary restrictions be stored for automated suggestions?
>    - For cost tracking, do you want support for multiple stores, and updating prices dynamically?
> 
> 9. Shopping Lists:
>    - Should shopping lists be auto-generated from meal plans or recipe collections?
>    - Would store availability checks require integration with external APIs or manual input?
> 
> Once we clarify these, I can prepare a structured plan and then move forward with designing the backend. Let me know your thoughts or ask if you want me to guide you through these points!

## 5. User Message

> 1. User Roles:
> 
> Answer: "Three user roles: Regular Users (create/share recipes), Premium Users (advanced meal planning, cost tracking), and Moderators (review flagged content, manage reported reviews). No full admin role needed - keep it focused on the core platform." 2. Recipe Details:
> 
> Answer: "Track comprehensive nutritional data: calories, protein, carbs, fat, fiber, sodium, sugar, plus key vitamins (A, C, D) and minerals (iron, calcium). For ingredients: precise quantities with units (cups, grams, tablespoons), brand optional but stored when provided for cost accuracy."
> 
> 3. Tags & Categories:
> 
> Answer: "Mix of both: Pre-defined categories (cuisine: Italian, Mexican, Asian; diet: vegan, keto, gluten-free, paleo; difficulty: beginner, intermediate, advanced) plus user-generated tags for flexibility. Users can suggest new categories for moderator approval."4. Rating & Reviews:
> 
> Answer: "5-star rating system with detailed text reviews. Include review helpfulness voting and flagging for inappropriate content. Moderators can hide reviews but should maintain audit trail of all moderation actions."
> 
> 5. Following & Feed:
> 
> Answer: "Personalized feed algorithm: 60% followed users' recent recipes, 25% trending recipes in user's preferred categories, 15% recommended based on past recipe interactions. Feed should update in real-time when users post new recipes."
> 
> 6. Searching by Ingredients:
> 
> Answer: "Smart search: Users can search with ingredients they have, system finds recipes using ANY of those ingredients. Include partial matching ('almond' finds 'almond milk', 'almond flour'). Rank results by percentage of ingredients user has available."
> 
> 7. Personal Collections & Meal Plans:
> 
> Answer: "Users create named collections (e.g., 'Quick Dinners', 'Holiday Recipes'). Meal planning integrates with calendar - users drag recipes to specific dates/meals. Generate weekly shopping lists from meal plans. Support recurring meal plans (e.g., 'My Standard Week')."
> 
> 8. Ingredient Substitutions & Nutritional Adjustments:
> 
> Answer: "Store 3-5 common substitutes per ingredient with conversion ratios (e.g., 1 cup butter = 1 cup applesauce = 0.5 cups + 0.5 cups oil). Auto-adjust nutritional values when substitutions made. Track user dietary preferences (vegan, low-sodium) to prioritize relevant substitutions. For cost tracking, support 3 major grocery chains with weekly price updates."
> 
> 9. Shopping Lists:
> 
> Answer: "Auto-generate shopping lists from meal plans with smart consolidation (if multiple recipes need eggs, combine quantities). Check ingredient availability at user's preferred stores via mock API integration. Include cost estimates and suggest store alternatives for better prices."
> 
> These requirements should give you enough detail to create a comprehensive system. Focus on making the ingredient substitution logic robust since that's the core differentiator. If any requirements seem unclear as you work through the design, make reasonable assumptions and document them in your analysis. Please proceed with the requirements analysis report.

## 10. Interface

- operations: 200
- schemas: 206

## 11. User Message

> Let's go with E2E Test Functions

## 12. Test

- functions: 240
- success: true

## 13. User Message

> The E2E test files have multiple TypeScript compilation errors that need to be fixed:
> 
> 1. Fix unterminated regular expression literals and invalid characters
> 2. Handle potentially undefined properties with proper null checks (e.g., 'unit.abbreviation' is possibly 'undefined')
> 3. Add missing required properties like 'created_at' and 'updated_at' to test objects
> 4. Fix type mismatches where strings don't match expected enum types (e.g., meal types should be "breakfast" | "lunch" | "dinner")
> 5. Remove or properly handle properties that don't exist in the expected types
> 6. Add proper type guards for potentially undefined variables
> 
> Please regenerate all the E2E test files with proper TypeScript compilation and fix these validation errors. Ensure all test objects match their corresponding interface definitions exactly.
